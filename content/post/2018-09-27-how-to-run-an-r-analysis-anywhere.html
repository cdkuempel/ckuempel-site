<p>I’ve been meaning to make all of my projects easily accessible on the cloud for a while now mostly for greater reproducibility. But other things (<em>ahem</em> actually writing code, <em>ahem ahem</em> labwork) have taken priority, so I never made everything fully cloud-deployable. Then I forgot my laptop charger at lab on a Friday before a three-day weekend. I now had much more motivation to achieve my goal. With a few hours’ battery charge left, it was time to get my workflow on the cloud (then find someone’s computer to borrow)! These are my notes for how to do so.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>There are basically four components for running everything on the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>a place to store code</li>
<li>a place to store data</li>
<li>a computing environment</li>
<li>a server to run everything</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various solutions to these problems, but I use, respectively: <strong>github</strong>, <strong>google drive</strong>, <strong>docker</strong>, and <strong>digital ocean</strong>.</p>
<div id="launch-an-r-container-on-digital-ocean" class="section level2">
<h2>Launch an R container on digital ocean</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> is cloud services platform. They do a lot of things, but the pertinent one for this post are their convenient <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/">One-click Applications</a> that let you run servers (“droplets” in Digital Ocean parlance) for specific tasks very easily.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is a freely-available system for running self-contained computing environments. It’s great for reproducible research because it takes all the uncertainty out of the user’s computer settings like software versions and dependencies. Even better, the <a href="https://www.rocker-project.org">Rocker Project</a> maintains pre-built Docker images for R, so you don’t have to worry about building it yourself (for R projects, anyways).</p>
<p>I use Digital Ocean’s Docker application to run a Docker image on a server, which I can then access from a browser on any computer.</p>
<p>Here’s how:</p>
<p>Create an account and login to Digital Ocean. Click the green <strong>Create</strong> button in the upper right. Select <strong>Droplets</strong>, then under <strong>Choose an Image</strong>, click <strong>One-click Apps</strong>, then <strong>Docker</strong>. From here, you can choose how much juice you want your server to have and how much you want to pay for it. For typical R sessions, I’ve found the default $20 per month (3 cents per hr) server to be fine, or perhaps the next tier up. If most longish-running analyses take less than a day to a few days, this only costs you a few cups of coffee<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Once the droplet is running, copy the IP address. In the terminal, run <code>ssh root@&lt;IP address&gt;</code>. Type the password provided in the email sent when the droplet got created (if you don’t have an SSH key setup).</p>
<p>To launch one of the <a href="https://www.rocker-project.org">Rocker R containers</a> (e.g., tidyverse), run</p>
<pre class="console"><code>docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e USER=&lt;user name&gt; -e PASSWORD=&lt;clever password&gt; -e ROOT=true rocker/verse</code></pre>
<p>Note that you need to provide <code>USER</code>, <code>PASSWORD</code>, and <code>ROOT</code>with the <code>-e</code> argument. Previous versions of Rocker containers would just allow you to sign in with login and password both “rstudio” by default, but no more.</p>
<p>Access the RStudio Server from your browser at <code>http://&lt;IP ADDRESS&gt;:8787</code>.</p>
<p>Login using the username and password you specified with the <code>docker run</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-your-code" class="section level2">
<h2>Get your code</h2>
<p>I’m going to assume ya’ll know about git and github. If not, Jenny Bryan’s <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git with R</a> is a great place to start from an R-centric perspective, and there are loads of other resources out there.</p>
<p>RStudio Server gives us everything we need to edit and run R code from a browser window, but the working directory is still empty. We need to pull down our code from github.</p>
<p>First though, let’s create a new project in RStudio to house our code. This will allow us to access useful tools like the RStudio interface to git.</p>
<p>Click <strong>File</strong> → <strong>New Project</strong> → <strong>New Directory</strong> → <strong>New Project</strong>. Enter the name for your project and check the <strong>Create a git repository</strong> box.</p>
<p>In the RStudio terminal window (the “terminal” tab is next to the “console” tab), add your remote repo with the canonical name “origin” for pulling code:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;.git</code></pre>
<p>Pull your code (you may need to delete the existing <code>.gitignore</code> file first):</p>
<pre class="console"><code>git pull origin master</code></pre>
<p>Tell git who you are:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>git config --global user.name &quot;My Name&quot;
git config --global user.email myname@somewhere.com</code></pre>
<p>Now you should be able to edit code, save it, and push changes to your github repo.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-your-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Get your data</h2>
<p>The above steps may be all you need to run analyses and edit R code in RStudio on the cloud. However, my project also includes some large raw data files that are too big to host on github (and I wouldn’t want to track raw data anyways). My solution to this is google drive and the <code>googledrive</code> <a href="https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/index.html">R package</a>.</p>
<p>You could either use usual google drive folders or a backup folder to host data, but I prefer the backup method. That way I don’t have to move my raw data to a google drive folder, and I get an extra back-up to boot.</p>
<p>First, install <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/">Backup and Sync</a>.</p>
<p>Select the data folder you want to backup, and wait for everything to upload.</p>
<p>Install the <code>googledrive</code> R package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;googledrive&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The first time you use <code>googledrive</code>, it will ask you if you want to “use a local file (‘.httr-oauth’), to cache OAuth access credentials between R sessions”? This is a very convenient way to securely access your google account, because the login info is stored in the <code>.httr-oauth</code> file, and you won’t be tempted to save it in code or have to enter it manually every time. Be sure to add <code>.httr-oauth</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> to keep it out of your repo though.</p>
<p>You will need to find the path to your data folder on google drive. This may take some trial and error, depending on how your google drive is organized. The <a href="https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_ls.html"><code>drive_ls()</code></a> function is your friend here. The name of the folder I selected for back-up is <code>data_raw</code>, and its path on google drive is <code>My MacBook Pro/data_raw/</code>.</p>
<div id="downloading-files-simple-case" class="section level3">
<h3>Downloading files: simple case</h3>
<p>If your backed-up data folder only consists of files within a single folder and no subdirectories, downloading it is simple.</p>
<p>Here I use the path to my <code>data_raw</code> folder on my google drive as an example. Create an empty <code>data_raw</code> folder within the RStudio project, then run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>folder_contents &lt;- drive_ls(&quot;My MacBook Pro/data_raw/&quot;)

purrr::walk2(
    map(folder_contents$id, as_id),
    paste0(&quot;data_raw/&quot;, folder_contents$name),
    drive_download,
    overwrite = TRUE
  )</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="downloading-files-dealing-with-subfolders" class="section level3">
<h3>Downloading files: dealing with subfolders</h3>
<p>If your data are organized into subfolders, things are a bit more tricky because <code>googledrive</code> only downloads files, not folders. Hopefully your organization scheme doesn’t have too many subfolders, which make things hard to follow anyways. There is probably a way to recursively download everything and preserve the folder structure, but my work-around for now is to download files on a per-folder basis.</p>
<p>I include a <code>README.MD</code> describing the files for each subfolder in <code>data</code> or <code>data_raw</code>, and track it with git (probably a good idea anyways). This way, my folder structure is preserved in the repo even though I ignore all the other raw data files.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelnitta/d38184c2554963d41587b910595ea081">a function</a> based on the above code to filter out subfolders and download all the files in folder. I also put it in my lovely <code>jntools</code> <a href="https://github.com/joelnitta/jntools">R package</a>.</p>

<div id="wrap-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>That’s pretty much it.</p>
<p>Be careful about downloading any results though, but because once the container is gone, anything inside it disappears for good!</p>
