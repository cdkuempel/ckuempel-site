<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>NARA is the U.S. national records archive with &gt;100 terabytes of data and an open API</li>
<li>The data are deeply nested and a pain to navigate</li>
<li>I show how to extract and tidy the useful bits</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-nara-api" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the NARA API?</h2>
<p>NARA is the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/">The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/publications/general-info-leaflets/1-about-archives.html">website</a>, the NARA collection includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äúapproximately 10 billion pages of textual records; 12 million maps, charts, and architectural and engineering drawings; 25 million still photographs and graphics; 24 million aerial photographs; 300,000 reels of motion picture film; 400,000 video and sound recordings; and 133 terabytes of electronic data.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if you‚Äôre interested in big data, this is your kind of place! Traditionally, most ‚Äúrecords‚Äù were physical objects stored in archives, but these days NARA is getting better and better about digitazation and open access. I only know this because a certain somebody who does a lot of research in the archives said to me the other day ‚ÄúHey, NARA says they have an <a href="https://github.com/usnationalarchives/Catalog-API">API</a>. What can we do with that?‚Äù ü§î</p>
<p>This person happens to be researching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans">internment of Japanese Americans during WWII</a>. The main U.S. government agency involved in this regrettable activity was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Relocation_Authority">War Relocation Authority</a>.</p>
<p>Googling failed to turn up any existing R package to interface with the NARA API, despite its hugeness. Look like it‚Äôs time to roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs query ‚Äúwar relocation authority‚Äù on the NARA API, get those data into R, and see what they have to say!</p>
</div>
<div id="set-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Set-up</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(listviewer)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="data-import" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Import</h2>
<p>NARA has an open API, with the base URL <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/api/v1" class="uri">https://catalog.archives.gov/api/v1</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/usnationalarchives/Catalog-API/blob/master/search_and_export.md">github documentation</a> has a very helpful explanation of how to query the API, as well as a <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/interactivedocumentation">sandbox</a> to test things out. Here, we are going to restrict our results to just ‚Äúitems‚Äù, which <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/data-model/">according to NARA‚Äôs data model</a> are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe smallest intellectually indivisible archival unit (e.g.¬†a letter, memorandum, report, leaflet, or photograph).‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we were not to do so, the search would also turn up loads of metadata including bits of <code>.gov</code> websites, collections of items, etc. We specify our query terms with <code>q=war%20relocation%20authority</code> and filter by the ‚Äúitem‚Äù result type with <code>resultTypes=item</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>initial_search &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(&quot;https://catalog.archives.gov/api/v1?&amp;q=war%20relocation%20authority&amp;resultTypes=item&quot;, simplifyVector = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>How are the data structured? Let‚Äôs look at the top 3 levels to get started.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(initial_search, max.level = 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## List of 1
##  $ opaResponse:List of 4
##   ..$ @status: chr &quot;200&quot;
##   ..$ time   : chr &quot;2018-08-13T20:47:51.621Z&quot;
##   ..$ request:List of 5
##   .. ..$ format     : chr &quot;json&quot;
##   .. ..$ pretty     : logi TRUE
##   .. ..$ action     : chr &quot;search&quot;
##   .. ..$ q          : chr &quot;war%20relocation%20authority&quot;
##   .. ..$ resultTypes: chr &quot;item&quot;
##   ..$ results:List of 5
##   .. ..$ queryTime: int 50
##   .. ..$ total    : int 5479
##   .. ..$ offset   : int 0
##   .. ..$ rows     : int 10
##   .. ..$ result   :List of 10</code></pre>
<p>We see that everything is contained in a single list item, which is unnamed. Not sure what the purpose of that is. üòï</p>
<p>Drilling down a bit, <code>$opaResponse</code> contains <code>$request</code>, which holds metadata about our query. <code>$opaResponse</code> also contains <code>$results</code>, which sounds more like what we‚Äôre interested in!</p>
<p>Notice that we had 5479 total results, but only 10 items in <code>$results$result</code>. This is because the default API query only returns that top 10 results. Now that we know how many results to expect, let‚Äôs specify that in a ‚Äúreal‚Äù query. In the API, we can indicate the maximum number of results to return (up to 10,000) with <code>rows=</code>. Note that this one will take much longer to download.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Wait 5 minutes so we don&#39;t overload the API with requests
Sys.sleep(300)

# Set a timer
start_time &lt;- Sys.time()

# Call the API
json_raw &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(&quot;https://catalog.archives.gov/api/v1?&amp;q=war%20relocation%20authority&amp;resultTypes=item&amp;rows=5479&quot;, simplifyVector = FALSE)

# See how long it took
finish_time &lt;- Sys.time()
finish_time - start_time</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Time difference of 28.07262 mins</code></pre>
<p>From our glimpse into the structure of the initial results, we know that the data we‚Äôre interested in are nested down in <code>$opaResponse$results$result</code>. Let‚Äôs extract those as <code>json_data</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>json_data &lt;- json_raw$opaResponse$results$result
nresults &lt;- length(json_data)
nresults</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5479</code></pre>
<p>OK, so how are the ‚Äúreal‚Äù results structured? There‚Äôs no way to check each one, so let‚Äôs grab 10 randomly and have a look.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(3098) # for reproducibility
jsonedit(json_data[sample(1:nresults, 10)])</code></pre>

Commonwealth of \nVirginia and the State of North Carolina could upgrade the railroad corridor between \nRichmond and Charlotte to achieve those States‚Äô passenger train travel time goals, with \nconsistent on-time performance for all freight and passenger operations. \nThe Corridor Today (Chapter 2)1\nAs a critical link in a longer rail route linking the Northeastern States with \nVirginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida,2 the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor consists \nof three distinct components, as shown in Figure ES-1: \n‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúS Line,‚Äù a route of \nthe CSXT Corporation \n(CSXT) between \nRichmond and Raleigh \n(North Carolina), more \nthan half of which was \nabandoned in the 1980s, \nand most of the rest of \nwhich CSXT operates \nin light-density freight \nservice3; \n‚Ä¢ The Raleigh‚Äì\nGreensboro (North \nCarolina) ‚ÄúH Line,‚Äù \nowned by the North \nCarolina Railroad and \noperated under \nmoderate traffic density by the Norfolk Southern (NS) Railroad; and \nFigure ES-1:  \nSchematic of Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor \n‚Ä¢ The Piedmont Main Line (‚ÄúP Line‚Äù), also owned by the North Carolina \nRailroad4 and operated by the NS as a heavy density freight route. \nThe S Line accounts for almost half the mileage.  If it is subdivided into its active \nand abandoned portions, then the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor may be viewed as \nconsisting of four parts, roughly equal in length, but each with its own distinct physical \n                                                 \n1 Chapter references are to the Main Report. \n2 This longer route has been Federally designated as the ‚ÄúSoutheast Corridor‚Äù for possible future improved \nrail passenger service. \n3 See the section ‚ÄúImportant Note on the Environmental Process‚Äù in Chapter 1 of the Main Report. \n4 Except for the segment between central Charlotte and the Charlotte Airport. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nand operating characteristics (see Figure ES-2).  At the time the \nresearch for this monograph occurred, the study team regarded the \nH and P Lines as being in a ‚Äústate of good repair,‚Äù meaning that \nthe track was of a quality that met or exceeded the requirements \nof the Federal Railroad Administration‚Äôs (FRA‚Äôs) railroad safety \nregulations for the speeds and traffic types that it supported. \nState Goals for the Corridor (Chapter 3) \nFor improved corridor passenger service between \nRichmond and Charlotte, the States (Virginia and North Carolina) have set a travel time \ngoal of four hours, 25 minutes with five stops‚éØa 42 percent reduction from existing \ntravel times (Figure ES-3). \nFigure ES-2:  \nMileages as Percent of \nCorridor Total \nFigure ES-3:  \nState Travel Time Goals  \nfor Improved Corridor Passenger Service5\nThe States have also set service frequency goals for improved corridor passenger \ntrains: four daily round trips between Northeast Corridor points, Richmond, and \nCharlotte; plus an additional five daily round trips between Raleigh and Charlotte.   \nThese intended frequencies, as well as projected frequencies for freight, conventional \npassenger,6 and commuter services, are summarized in Table ES-1. \nApproximately one-third of Amtrak‚Äôs Carolinian and Piedmont trains currently \narrive late at their final destination, largely due to conflicts between freight and passenger \nmovements on the single-track H Line and the partially single-track P line.  Since both  \n                                                 \n5 The actual time for 2001 is the average of southbound and northbound timings for the Carolinian. \n6 I.e., long-distance trains in the traffic lanes between the Northeast Corridor and Florida, and between the \nNortheast Corridor, Atlanta, and New Orleans. \n ES-2\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nfreight and passenger trains are important to the economies of North Carolina and \nVirginia, the need to relieve current, and avoid new, bottlenecks for all services has \nfundamentally influenced the analysis underlying this monograph.  This emphasis on \nreliability is all the more important because the future could see a doubling or tripling of \ntrain movements on the H and P Lines.    \nTable ES-1: Projected Daily Train Movements by Service Type and Segment \nS Line  \n(Active Portion,  \nNorlina‚ÄìRaleigh Only)\nH Line \n(Raleigh‚ÄìGreensboro) \nP Line \n(Greensboro‚ÄìCharlotte)\nNOTE:  ‚ÄúDaily train movements‚Äù are the sum \nof one-way operations in the two opposing \ndirections‚éØi.e., double the number of daily \nround trips.7  2001 \nExisting \n2020  \nProjection\n2001 \nExisting \n2020  \nProjection \n2001 \nExisting \n2020  \nProjection \nIntercity Passenger Trains:       \nCorridor (improved by 2020) 0 8 4 18 4 18 \nLong-Distance 0 2 0 0 2 4 \nTotal, Intercity Passenger Trains 0 10 4 18 6 22 \nCommuter Trains (Charlotte region) 0 0 0 0 0 22 \nFreight Trains 4 14 8 8 25 33 \nTotal Daily Movements for All Services 4 24 12 26 31 77 \nAs Percent of Existing Movements 100% 600% 100% 217% 100% 248% \n \nOperations Analysis (Chapter 4) \nThe analysis took place under the direction of the corridor planning staff of the \nFRA, with full participation by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of North \nCarolina, Amtrak, the North Carolina Railroad, and CSX Transportation.  The Norfolk \nSouthern Corporation chose not to participate.  In an iterative process, the study team \ncombined its knowledge of existing conditions on the lines in question, with conceptual \nplans for a number of fixed facility improvements that would raise train speeds, improve \ncapacity, and meet safety, operational, or marketing prerequisites.  Simulations of train \nperformance in the planning year (2020) were conducted over various hypothetical fixed \nfacility configurations, and with various equipment performance specifications assumed.  \nThese simulations were of two types: \n‚Ä¢ Calculations of pure train performance in the absence of interference from \nother trains; and \n‚Ä¢ Seven-day simulations of the performance of, and interference among, all \nthe freight, intercity passenger, and commuter train movements envisioned \nin Table ES-1 above.  For this purpose, hypothetical schedules of all these \nmovements were developed; the simulation technique modeled the effects \n                                                 \n7 Train movements for the P Line are the average of the train movements for its two constituent segments, \nGreensboro‚ÄìSpencer Yard and Spencer Yard‚ÄìCharlotte.  For details, see Tables 2-5 and 3-1 in the Main \nReport. \n ES-3\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nof randomness, for example in the arrival of long-distance freight trains at \nentry points to the corridor. \nThe results of this analysis of operations were as follows: \n‚Ä¢ The States‚Äô trip time goals, while challenging, are achievable. \n‚Ä¢ Train equipment exists that could reliably travel between Richmond and \nCharlotte in four hours, 25 minutes with five intermediate stops, subject to \nthe completion of the improvements contemplated in this study. \n‚Ä¢ The system configuration that would allow the trip time goals to be met \nwould include: \n‚Äï Maximum authorized speeds of 110 mph; \n‚Äï Non-electric trainsets with two locomotives and six cars; \n‚Äï Tilting capability in the cars; \n‚Äï Unbalanced superelevation of up to seven inches8; and \n‚Äï The recommended alignment, as described in Chapters 5 and 6. \n‚Ä¢ To the extent that the States were to substitute other system configurations \nand improvements for those contemplated in this report, the alterations \nwould need to have the same net effect on speed, capacity, safety, and \nmarketability as those described in this monograph, for the goals to be \nreliably met. \nThe Contemplated Improvements (Chapters 5 and 6) \nThe monograph classifies corridor betterments into two main categories: \n‚Ä¢ Systemic upgrades of corridor-wide railroad components (for example, \nthe signaling system).  These9 form the subject matter of Chapter 5; and \n‚Ä¢ Site-specific projects (for example, track reconfigurations).  These are \nexamined in Chapter 6. \nThe following sections summarize the major elements of the contemplated \nimprovement program, for both systemic and site-specific projects. 10\n                                                 \n8 See the Glossary (at the end of Volume 1) for an explanation of terms.  This specification would be \namong those subject to the review and approval of the FRA‚Äôs Office of Safety. \n9 Chapter 5 also describes corridor-wide engineering standards that were applied to site-specific projects, as \nwell as certain program elements which are site-specific in essence, but for which corridor-wide cost \nestimates are presented. \n10 While this listing should assist the States in considering, and possibly implementing, further development \nof this corridor, the precise nature, scope, and cost of the systemic and site-specific improvements are, of \ncourse, subject to more detailed planning and engineering work. \n ES-4\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nRestoration of the Abandoned S Line \nWorthy of special note is the contemplated restoration of the now-abandoned \nportion of the S Line between Centralia (Virginia) and Norlina (North Carolina).  This \n88-mile segment would be rebuilt to modern standards with new wooden ties, continuous \nwelded rail, premium fasteners for track stability, and turnouts allowing for diverging \npassenger moves at 45 mph.  On curves to be operated at high speeds, concrete ties would \nbe installed.  The route would benefit from numerous curve realignments and relocations, \nwhich would be relatively easy and economical to accomplish on an inactive right-of-\nway.  Of some 63 public highway-railroad grade crossings formerly on this abandoned \nsegment, eight would be eliminated and 55 would be restored with gates and flashers.11  \nSaving some 34 miles, or one-fifth, of the distance of today‚Äôs circuitous route \nbetween Petersburg and Raleigh, restoration of the S Line would bring other components \nof railway technology up to the standards to be applied elsewhere on the Corridor, and is \ntreated in this monograph as a single site-specific project.12   \nImprovements on the Active S, H, and P Lines \nTrack Structure \nThe currently-active portions of the S Line (Richmond‚ÄìCentralia, Norlina‚Äì\nRaleigh) and the Raleigh‚ÄìFetner (North Carolina) segment of the H Line would undergo \na significant upgrade, with replacement of rails and other track components to assure \nsafe, expeditious passenger and freight service.   In order to make the track structure \nstable for tilting trains where they operate at between five and seven inches of unbalanced \nsuperelevation, approximately 100 track-miles of curves would receive concrete ties and  \npremium fasteners.13  All other currently-active trackage in the Corridor is assumed to \ncontinue in the state of good repair that was perceived during the research for this study, \nalthough some surfacing would be required to support the proposed maximum authorized \nspeeds on the H and P Lines. \nCurve Realignments \nIntended to lengthen the stretches of track available for high-speed running, \nalignment improvements would cover a broad spectrum from adjustments (sometimes \nmeasured in inches) within the existing right-of-way, to major relocations outside the \nright-of-way.  The adjustments would affect the banking of curves (‚Äúsuperelevation‚Äù), the \ntransition sections (‚Äúspirals‚Äù) from straight to curved trackage, and in some cases the \n                                                 \n11 Three new public crossings would be added, also with gate and flasher protection.  Also, of the 20 private \ncrossings identified in limited field work as potentially active on the restored line, ten would be closed and \nten would be provided with gates and flashers. \n12 See the section ‚ÄúImportant Note on the Environmental Process‚Äù in Chapter 1 of the Main Report.  \n13 Solely to minimize initial capital costs, wooden ties are assumed for the remainder of the trackage.  \nSuitable transitions would be provided between the concrete and wooden tie sections.  If sufficient funds \nprove to be available, installation of concrete ties throughout the corridor would be beneficial. \n ES-5\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\ndegree of curvature itself.  Over all the active portions of the Corridor, 14 a total of 39 \nidentifiable curve adjustment projects would occur, spaced on average at six- to seven-\nmile intervals.  By contrast, only ten relocations are envisioned, with seven on the H \nLine, two on the active S Line, and one on the P Line.  A single relocation project on the \nS Line would eliminate or ease 17 curves south of Wake Forest for a near-doubling of the \nspeed limit15 and a travel time reduction of 2.6 minutes. \nTrack Layout Reconfigurations \nBoth the S and H Lines are \nessentially single-track railroads, as \ndisplayed in Figure ES-4, and about \none-third of the P Line is single-track \nterritory.  The projected 2020 train \nvolumes will not fit into such a \nconstrained physical plant reliably, if \nat all.  Therefore, many track layout \nreconfigurations are contemplated in \nthis monograph.  They can be characterized generally as follows: \nFigure ES-4:  \nPercentage of Single Track Territory by Line, 2001 \n‚Ä¢ In single-track territory, sidings would be added or expanded to be 3.5 to \nfour miles long, with 11 miles of single track between sidings.16  The \nturnouts giving access to and from sidings would allow for 45 mph \npassenger speeds (40 mph for freight) for trains entering or leaving the \nsiding.   \n‚Ä¢ The P Line would be restored to its former double-track status throughout, \nwith appropriately placed interlockings (where trains can move between \ntracks).  Approximately one-fifth of the P Line would be triple-tracked, \nmainly through the addition of long center sidings that would maximize \noperating flexibility in both directions. \n‚Ä¢ Reconfigurations at major stations, and in the vicinity of important yards, \nwould enhance fluidity by allowing all types of trains to do their work or \nreach their destinations more quickly, thus freeing up the main tracks for \nfollowing movements.  Chapter 6 details the rationales for, and intricacies \nof, these site-specific reconfigurations, particularly at Raleigh, Durham, \nGreensboro, Spencer Yard/Salisbury, and Charlotte. \n                                                 \n14 Curve realignments, like all other improvements within the abandoned segments of the S Line, are \nconsidered part of the S Line Restoration project. \n15 From the former 60 mph for passenger trains, to 100 or 110 mph. \n16 Siding spacings and lengths would vary due to local conditions, the presence of grade crossings, and \nother limiting factors. \n ES-6\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nSignaling and Train Control \nA modern system of automatic train control, cab signals, and reverse signaling \nwould be installed throughout the Corridor.  This system would meet the FRA‚Äôs safety \nrequirements for train operations over 79 mph by automatically enforcing restrictive \nsignals through the electronics of each locomotive.  It would also promote operational \nflexibility by allowing trains to operate on any track in either direction.  \nStations \nProperly sited, designed, and accessed stations are prerequisite to the \nmarketability of improved rail service corridors.  Table ES-2 summarizes the station \nprogram contemplated in this monograph.  Stations are assumed to have low-level \nplatforms,17 fulfill applicable Americans with Disability Act requirements, and provide \nadequate passenger accommodation, parking, and access/egress to assure marketability of \nthe Corridor‚Äôs passenger transportation product.  However, only selected operational \naspects of stations were included in the conceptual planning in this study and the related \ncost estimates (see ‚ÄúProgram Summary,‚Äù below). \nTable ES-2: Contemplated Station Program \n   Disposition \nMile- \npost18 Location19\nMetro \nArea \nPopulation20\nExisting, \nRestored, and/or \nReopened \nAssumed \nRelocation \nAssumed \nNew Stop \nS0 Richmond - Main Street Station ‚Ä¢   \nS22.0 Petersburg \n997,000 \n‚Ä¢21   \nS113.8 Henderson 16,095 ‚Ä¢   \nH80.4 Raleigh  ‚Ä¢  \nH72.7 Cary ‚Ä¢   \nH54.7 Durham \n1,188,000 \n ‚Ä¢  \nH21.5 Burlington ‚Ä¢   \nH0.1 Greensboro  ‚Ä¢  \n299.2 High Point \n1,252,000 \n‚Ä¢   \nP333.3 Salisbury ‚Ä¢   \nP348.9 Kannapolis ‚Ä¢   \nP367.1 I-485   ‚Ä¢ \nP377.8 Charlotte  ‚Ä¢  \nP383.2 Charlotte Airport \n1,499,000 \n  ‚Ä¢ \nTotal population, Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor \nonly22 4,952,095  \n                                                 \n17 High-level platforms would be desirable in a number of locations if funds are available. \n18 Relocated stations will show different milepost numbers than are reflected in Table 2-4 of the Main \nReport.. \n19 Chapter 7 of the Main Report specifies what costs categories are included for each station. \n20 Populations are for Metropolitan Statistical Areas or for the city or town‚éØwhichever is the largest \napplicable to the station.

Thus a relocated station is a distinct possibility.  \n ES-7\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nGrade Crossing Improvements \nNorth Carolina‚Äôs Sealed Corridor Project‚éØan effort to systematically improve \nsafety at the highway-rail grade crossings on the North Carolina Railroad23‚éØhas \nestablished the principle that improved rail passenger service can and should be \naccompanied by reduced risk of motor vehicle/train collisions.  Accordingly, this study \nhas developed a preliminary program to deal with the 370 public and private crossings on \nthe active S, H, and P Lines.  Contemplated treatments for these crossings appear in \nFigure ES-5 and Figure ES-6. \nFigure ES-5: Contemplated Disposition of \nPublic Highway-Rail Grade Crossings \nTotal Crossing Sites24: 298 \n(Active S, H, and P Lines) \nFigure ES-6: Contemplated Disposition of \nPrivate Highway-Rail Grade Crossings \nTotal Crossing Sites : 72 \n(Active S, H, and P Lines) \n \nFencing \nThis study assumes that approximately ten percent of the corridor might require \nfencing of both sides of the right-of-way to improve safety and minimize the potential for \ntrespassing. \n                                                                                                                                                 \n22 The important points served by through services, such as Washington, Baltimore, and other Northeast \nCorridor population centers, are not included in this total. \n23 For details on this trailblazing effort, see Federal Railroad Administration, North Carolina Phase I \nU.S.DOT Assessment Report, Report to Congress, May 2002, available as this monograph goes to press at  \nhttp://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/Research/rdv_rep2congress.pdf .  This State/railroad partnership has \nshown that driver run-around violations at crossings can be reduced by up to 98 percent through the \ninstallation of four-quadrant gates, median roadway barriers, and other innovations. Further information on \nthe Sealed Corridor Program may be obtained from the North Carolina Department of Transportation‚Äôs Rail \nDivision at http://www.bytrain.org/safety/ . \n24 ‚ÄúTotal Crossing Sites‚Äù equals the total number of existing crossings plus likely sites for additional \ncrossings. The latter, amounting to two public and two private sites, are generally introduced to substitute \nfor crossings slated for elimination. \n ES-8\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nEquipment and Support Facilities \nEquipment \nAlthough this monograph emphasizes fixed facility improvements, the study team \nis mindful that the success of improved rail passenger service depends heavily on the \nacquisition of locomotives and cars (or complete ‚Äútrainsets‚Äù) that can‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ Meet or exceed the travel time goals safely and reliably; \n‚Ä¢ Comply with the engineering specifications of all rail facilities over which \nthey may be called to operate‚éØfor example, the Northeast Corridor; \n‚Ä¢ Provide levels of passenger comfort, convenience, and amenities that \nwould compete with those of other modes while enhancing the transport \neconomics of the rail service; \n‚Ä¢ Provide consistent availability over the units‚Äô economic life, and hopefully \nbeyond, with industry-standard maintenance; and \n‚Ä¢ Incur operating and maintenance cost levels that would support the service \non a long-term, economic basis. \nShould the States elect to pursue development of this corridor, the equipment \nacquisition project should be accorded at least the same urgency, and given at least the \nsame lead-times, as the fixed facility projects contained in this monograph.  In this \nmanner, adequate time and thought would be available for the specification, design, \nsource selection, prototype testing, production, and acceptance testing of an equipment \nfleet25 that would exceed all the criteria listed above.  This methodical approach is all the \nmore necessary because equipment, which typically costs but a fraction of the fixed \nfacility expenditure,26 is nevertheless critical to the success of  any rail corridor \ninvestment effort. \nSupport Facilities \nThe study identified a need for equipment storage trackage, as well as servicing \nand inspection facilities, at Raleigh and Charlotte.  The storage yards would provide \nsufficient capacity for midday and overnight layovers of trains.  The Raleigh facility \nwould accommodate Raleigh‚ÄìCharlotte passenger trains, while the Charlotte facility \n                                                 \n25 Depending on the timing of corridor development, activities in other corridors, and the state of the rail \npassenger equipment industry at the time the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor is ready for service, ‚éØand \nsubject to the approval of FRA‚Äôs Office of Safety, ‚éØsome of these steps could potentially be combined or \nomitted. \n26 See, for example, Federal Railroad Administration, High-Speed Ground Transportation for America, \n1997 (‚ÄúFRA 1997‚Äù), Chapter 7 and the Statistical Supplement, for comparative infrastructure and \nequipment costs in a number of hypothetical corridors.  As this monograph goes to press, the FRA 1997 \nreport is available at  http://www.fra.dot.gov/Content3.asp?P=515 .  For the Southeast Corridor, FRA 1997 \nprojected that vehicles would account for 22 percent of the total initial investment; infrastructure, 77 \npercent; and ancillary items, one percent. \n ES-9\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nwould deal with both Raleigh‚ÄìCharlotte and Northeast Corridor‚ÄìCharlotte equipment.  \nServicing and storage facilities for this equipment at Northeast Corridor points, as well as \nfacilities for heavy repairs and overhauls, are outside the scope of this monograph. \nCost Estimates and Study Conclusions (Chapter 7) \nThe total cost27 of the improvements contemplated in this study, exclusive of \nitems to be determined, stands at about one billion dollars (see Table ES-3).  The \nfollowing sections point out noteworthy inclusions in, and exclusions from, this estimate. \nRestoration of Abandoned S Line \nThe S Line restoration is treated as a single project that includes all requisite \ncomponents of railway infrastructure.  It also includes $6.9 million for Petersburg Station \nplatforms and pedestrian access, for reasons explained in Chapter 7.   \nReal estate acquisition costs are uniformly omitted in this and all other line items. \nTrack Structure \nThe only separately-identified track structure improvement costs pertain to the \nactive portions of the S Line, and to the H Line between Raleigh and Fetner.  Otherwise, \nthe track on the H and P Lines is assumed to remain in a state of good repair that was \ndetected while this study was prepared.  Track surfacing in preparation for high-speed \noperations is not included in the cost estimates for the H and P Lines. \nCurve Realignments \nCurve realignment costs include the provision of concrete ties and premium \nfasteners in curves over which trains will operate with unbalanced superelevations of \nbetween five and seven inches.  \nTrack Layout Reconfigurations \nThe reconfiguration costs include associated signal and control system changes.  \nStations \nThe costs shown are primarily for platforms and pedestrian access structures.  \nBuildings are included only at two smaller sites (Henderson and Kannapolis), and at two \ncompletely new locations in the Charlotte area (I-485 and Charlotte Airport Station).  The \ncosts for all other buildings, and for all parking, motor vehicle, and transit access to the \nCorridor, are to be determined and are excluded from the totals.  \n                                                 \n27 Costs are expressed in Year 2000 dollars.   \n ES-10\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nT\nab\nle\n E\nS-\n3:\n S\num\nm\nar\ny \nof\n C\nos\nt E\nst\nim\nat\nes\n fo\nr \nPr\noj\nec\nts\n C\non\nte\nm\npl\nat\ned\n fo\nr \nth\ne \nR\nic\nhm\non\nd‚Äì\nC\nha\nrl\not\nte\n C\nor\nri\ndo\nr \nC\nos\nt E\nst\nim\nat\nes\n (M\nill\nio\nns\n o\nf D\nol\nla\nrs\n). \n \nB\nla\nnk\ns m\nea\nn:\n ‚Äú\nD\noe\ns n\not\n a\npp\nly\n.‚Äù\n  ‚Äú\ntb\nd‚Äù\n m\nea\nns\n: ‚Äú\nA\npp\nlie\ns, \nbu\nt i\ns t\no \nbe\n d\net\ner\nm\nin\ned\n.‚Äù\n  A\nll \nto\nta\nls \nar\ne \nex\ncl\nus\niv\ne \nof\n it\nem\ns t\no \nbe\n d\net\ner\nm\nin\ned\n. \nSy\nst\nem\n-W\nid\ne \nE\nst\nim\nat\nes\nSi\nte\n-S\npe\nci\nfic\n E\nst\nim\nat\nes\n \n \nR\nai\nlw\nay\n S\nys\nte\nm\n C\nom\npo\nne\nnt\ns \nSy\nst\nem\nic\nSi\nte\n-S\npe\nci\nfic\n \nE\nst\nim\nat\ned\n a\ns \na \nG\nro\nup\n \nS \nLi\nne\n -

Commuter service could become \nsubstantial, as well, in limited segments of the Corridor.  Thus, extensive \ncapacity expansions would be required if an expedited intercity passenger \nservice is to coexist reliably with other forms of rail transport; \n‚Ä¢ The Corridor‚éØwith its distinct S, H, and P Lines‚éØexemplifies light, \nmedium, and heavy-density railroad facilities and operations.  As a result, \nthis transportation planning monograph has applicability to a broad range \nof rail improvement projects across the country.   \nThe extensive investments necessary in the P Line as a prerequisite to \nhigh-speed corridor passenger service would, for instance, provide \nvaluable information to planners who would likewise superimpose high-\nspeed rail on other heavy-density freight routes.  In such cases, where \nparallel route alternatives exist and lightly-used or abandoned rights-of-\nway are available, the total cost to upgrade the capacity of the heavy-duty \nfreight line must be compared with the total cost to convert the lightly-\nused right-of-way for high-speed rail use.  Until the site-specific \nconditions are evaluated, planners cannot know which of the alternatives \noffers the soundest value under the economic theory of railway location.   \nIn this case, however, there is no practical alternative to the P Line \nbetween Greensboro and Charlotte. \nAcknowledgement \nThe transportation planning staff in the FRA‚Äôs Office of Railroad Development \nacknowledges and values the work of its engineering contractor, the Parsons \nTransportation Group, in performing complex analyses underlying this study.  Also \nappreciated is the participation of Amtrak, the North Carolina Department of \nTransportation, the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation, the North \nCarolina Railroad, CSX Transportation, and local officials in the important communities \nserved by the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor.   \n ES-12\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nFigures in Executive Summary \nFigure ES-1:  Schematic of Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor ......................................................

Should the States choose \nto effect their rail travel time goals for this corridor, they will need to undertake a set of \nprojects having similar effects on train performance capabilities as those enumerated \nhere. \nThe monograph discusses the origin and purpose of the underlying studies; the \ncorridor‚Äôs current condition and usage; its intended transportation role in the 21st Century; \nthe methodology for analyzing the corridor‚Äôs investment requirements; and a set of \nimprovements‚Äîboth corridor-wide and site-specific‚Äîthat would allow the Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte Corridor to provide enhanced intercity passenger, freight, and, ultimately, \ncommuter train services. The monograph analyzes the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte corridor in \nthe context of the evolving needs of the freight railroad industry, Amtrak, the States of \nNorth Carolina and Virginia, and regional entities where appropriate.  \nThe commercial feasibility report issued in 1997 by the Federal Railroad \nAdministration (FRA), High-Speed Ground Transportation for America, identified the \nSoutheast Corridor (of which the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor forms a part) as showing \nmarked potential for the development of high-speed rail service through private/public \npartnerships.  This pronounced ‚Äúpartnership potential‚Äù largely resulted from the \nassumption that net revenue increases on Amtrak‚Äôs Northeast Corridor resulting from \nthrough high-speed rail traffic to and from Southeast Corridor points, would be creditable \nto the Southeast Corridor.3  While leaving the details of any such partnership \narrangements to the States, Amtrak, and other concerned parties, the 1997 FRA report \nheightened public awareness of the opportunities presented by rail passenger service \nsouth of Washington. \n                                                 \n1 For an explanation of the term ‚Äúdesignated,‚Äù see the Supplement: Background Materials at the back of \nthis volume under ‚ÄúRail Corridor Designations .‚Äù  \n2 Subsequent to the initial designation of Washington‚ÄìRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte as a high-speed rail corridor, \nthe Southeast Corridor was extended to include South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. \n3 See Chapter 8 of FRA, High-Speed Ground Transportation for America, Main Report, September 1997; \nreferred to later in this monograph as ‚ÄúFRA 1997.‚Äù The report is available on the World Wide Web at \nhttp://www.fra.dot.gov/Content3.asp?P=515 (Web site references are current as of October 2003.) \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nMeanwhile, as the logical continuation of a series of Congressionally-mandated \ntransportation plans covering the Northeast Corridor and its extensions,4 Amtrak and the \nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) ‚éØsupported by the FRA, and \nwith the participation of the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation \n(VDRPT)‚éØbegan an evaluation of the requirements to create a rail passenger route \nconnecting Richmond, Virginia and Raleigh, Greensboro, and Charlotte, North Carolina, \nwhile allowing for possible future extension of the corridor southward to Georgia. Such a \nRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte route could require initiation of rail service on a path that has never \nprovided continuous, Amtrak intercity passenger service. In fact, one potential route \nsegment of the corridor‚éØbetween Richmond and Raleigh, via Centralia and Petersburg, \nVirginia and Norlina and Henderson, North Carolina‚éØhas not had rail passenger service \nsince the mid-1980s, and the Centralia‚ÄìNorlina portion has had its railroad track and \nsignal system removed since the late 1980s. \nNorth Carolina and Virginia envision train service reliably linking Richmond \n(Main Street Station) and Charlotte, North Carolina (at a new station to be constructed in \nthe vicinity of West 4th Street) in less than four hours and twenty-five minutes by 2020, \nwith five intermediate stops.5\nThe 2020 service would include nine daily trains in each direction, as follows: \n‚Ä¢  New York‚ÄìWashington‚ÄìRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte trains (four round trips); \nand \n‚Ä¢  Raleigh‚ÄìCharlotte trains (five round trips). \nOn the assumption that a trip time of less than two hours is attained for the \nRichmond-Washington route, travel times between New York and Charlotte would be \nabout 9.5 hours, while travel times between Washington and Charlotte would be slightly \nmore than 6.5 hours.   \nVirtually all the intercity service between Washington and points south would \noperate over the Northeast Corridor to or from New York City or points north.  In view of \nthe projected levels of Northeast Corridor high-speed, conventional, and commuter trains, \nthe intercity trains to and from the South must fit in certain operating windows at a \nnumber of ‚Äúchoke points‚Äù between New York and Washington, which would basically \n                                                 \n4 These Transportation Plans include those covering the New York‚ÄìBoston and New York‚ÄìWashington \nportions of the Northeast Corridor main line; the Washington‚ÄìRichmond portion of the Southeast Corridor \n(see footnote 5 below); and the portion of the Keystone Corridor between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, \nPennsylvania.  The most recent Congressional mandates for Transportation Plans of this nature appeared in \nthe 1996 Appropriations Act for the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies, and the Omnibus \nConsolidated Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999. \n5 Service between the restored Main Street Station in Richmond and Washington Union Station is projected \nto take less than two hours with three intermediate station stops.  For further information, readers may \nconsult the Washington‚ÄìRichmond study report which will be available on the FRA web site, \nhttp://www.fra.dot.gov  (Web site references are current as of October 2003.) \n 1-2\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\ndictate their arrival and departure times at Washington.  There would, therefore, be a \nneed for integrated planning of the Northeast Corridor and service south of Washington. \nThe planning for the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor also identified several issues \nrelated to the feasibility of operating the projected number of‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ Norfolk Southern (NS) freight trains between Raleigh and Charlotte; \n‚Ä¢ CSX Transportation (CSXT) freight trains between Richmond and \nCary, North Carolina;  \n‚Ä¢ Regionally proposed commuter trains using Charlotte as a hub; \n‚Ä¢ Increased levels of intercity passenger service in Virginia serving \nNewport News and Bristol6 through Main Street Station; and \n‚Ä¢ Amtrak service to Florida and Atlanta/New Orleans, which currently \nmakes use of portions of the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor. \nThe ongoing studies also identified the need to coordinate use of the corridor \nbetween Raleigh and Durham with proposed Triangle Transit Authority (TTA) light-rail \nservice that would construct its tracks within and alongside the right-of-way owned by \nthe North Carolina Railroad (NCRR). \nThe study scope was confined to fixed facility improvements that would safely \nsupport intended train schedules, frequencies, and service reliability through the year \n2020.  ‚ÄúService reliability‚Äù‚éØthat is, on-time performance for passenger and scheduled \nfreight services, and the consistent, expeditious, and economic movement of other freight \ntrains‚éØis of utmost importance because without it, higher passenger train speeds and \nfrequencies and restructured, modernized freight operations will not realize their potential \nfor enhancing the marketability of rail services.   \nOther types of improvements, including some which would be prerequisite to the \ndesired service and safety levels, did not undergo analysis for this monograph: for \nexample, provision of locomotives and cars, grade crossing hazard reduction, and \ndevelopment of station parking and amenities.  These categories of improvement would \nrequire careful attention in the more detailed planning and design that must precede any \nsignificant investment in the Corridor.  With respect to grade crossings, the States have \nalready made significant progress under existing programs.7\nPurpose in Brief \nThis monograph aims at specifying, on a preliminary basis, the infrastructure \nimprovements that would enable the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor to accommodate \nreliably the mix and volume of intercity passenger, commuter, and freight services that \nthe line‚Äôs operators and public partners foresee for the year 2020.   \n                                                 \n6 The Bristol service does not now exist, but is proposed. \n7 For particulars, see the respective web sites: for North Carolina, http://www.bytrain.org ; for Virginia, \nhttp://www.drpt.state.va.us/rail ; and for the Southeast Corridor, http://www.sehsr.org .  (Web site \nreferences are current as of October 2003.) \n 1-3\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nApproach \nThe Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor today experiences capacity shortfalls, \nparticularly between Greensboro and Charlotte on the NS Piedmont Main Line between \nWashington and Atlanta.8  Thus, a dependability challenge already affects the freight \nservices and the few passenger trains that use the corridor.  To establish the investment \nneeds for reliable services, this study has adopted a 20-year planning horizon, which \nwould allow sufficient time for high-speed and other improvements to be constructed and \nimplemented in a logical sequence.   \nIn view of the multiple uses of the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor, proper \nperformance of the study necessitated a team effort, in which Amtrak, FRA, the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, the State of North Carolina, and some freight railroad right-\nof-way owners and operators (the North Carolina Railroad and CSXT) participated.  \nAlthough invited to join the study effort, NS did not participate, with the result that all \nNS schedules and traffic projections had to be derived from other sources. \nThe study is based on the following comprehensive analytical approach:  \n‚Ä¢ Assess current facilities, services and operating conditions on the \nroute; \n‚Ä¢ Characterize service needs for the planning year 2020; \n‚Ä¢ Conduct operational analyses simulating the performance of future \n(year 2020) services over various configurations of infrastructure; and \n‚Ä¢ Identify the infrastructure investments that would allow the Corridor‚Äôs \noperators to achieve their intended 2020 service quality and train \nvolumes with satisfactory reliability. \nThe chapters that follow address each of these tasks in turn. \nImportant Note on the Environmental Process \n  Description and Status of the Process \nAll projects that use public funds must first examine potential environmental \nimpacts as part of the public decision-making process. North Carolina and Virginia, with \nparticipation from the FRA and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), are \nworking together on a two-part environmental study of the Southeast Corridor that \nevaluates all the potential impacts along possible routes. The first study phase‚éØreferred \nto as the Tier I Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)‚éØtakes a broad look at potential \nimpacts along nine possible routes. The second study phase‚éØTier II‚éØwill include more \nspecific analyses along one or more routes. \n                                                 \n8 Between Alexandria, Virginia, and Greensboro, North Carolina, the NS Washington‚ÄìAtlanta main line \nfollows a route lying to the west of the designated Southeast Corridor which is the subject of this        \nmonograph.  Between Greensboro and Charlotte (and on to Atlanta), the designated Southeast Corridor and \nthe NS main line are one and the same. \n 1-4\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nThe Southeast Corridor High-Speed Rail project has recently completed the Tier I \nstudy phase.  The Final EIS was made available on July 26, 2002, and the joint \nFRA/FHWA Record of Decision (ROD) was issued on October 18, 2002.9\nIn brief, the ROD selects the direct ‚ÄúS‚Äù line between Richmond and Raleigh, and \nthe North Carolina Railroad (‚ÄúH‚Äù and ‚ÄúP‚Äù lines10) between Raleigh, Durham, \nGreensboro, and Charlotte‚éØmodified with passenger connectivity to Winston-Salem‚éØas \nthe alternative that best meets the project's purpose and need while minimizing \nenvironmental impacts. The ROD also recommends that the route via the S, H, and P \nLines be developed first and that the portion providing connectivity to Winston-Salem be \ndeveloped in conjunction with the efforts of the Piedmont Authority for Regional \nTransportation, as appropriate. The Piedmont Authority for Regional Transportation is \nresponsible for coordinating the regional transportation system in the counties around the \nWinston-Salem connection. \nFollowing the ROD, Tier II environmental studies would evaluate details of track \nlocation, station arrangement and final design. The Tier II studies may take anywhere \nfrom a few months to several years to complete. Once completed, these documents would \nbe used to acquire the permits needed for construction. \nRelationship Between This Monograph and the Environmental Process \nThis study proceeded independently of, and simultaneously with, the preparation \nof the FEIS so that this monograph could achieve its purpose of describing the \ninfrastructure improvements necessary to provide high-speed intercity passenger rail \nservice between Richmond and Charlotte.  To enhance the understanding of the potential \ncosts and benefits of the project, the study was undertaken at the risk that all or portions \nof the route studied might not be selected in the environmental process. Certain \nassumptions had to be made regarding the location of the fixed plant to accomplish the \nstudy.  The assumed location for this monograph largely coincides with that contained in \nthe FEIS and ROD (the direct S Line between Richmond and Raleigh, and the North \nCarolina Railroad between Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, and Charlotte), because this \nroute has been the subject of numerous studies by the States of North Carolina and \nVirginia over recent years and because it presents favorable engineering and economic \nqualities.  Unlike the environmental process, the provision of connectivity to Winston \nSalem, as specified in the FEIS and ROD, was not assumed for the present monograph \nand no facilities or costs for a Winston-Salem service were included.  Adding \nconnectivity to Winston-Salem may require alterations in the conceptual designs and \ncosts of certain facilities11 described in this monograph, over and above the investments \nrequired for a Winston-Salem connection per se.   \n                                                 \n9 The ROD is available on the Internet at: http://www.fra.dot.gov/Content3.asp?P=1197   (Web site \nreferences are correct as of October 2003.) \n10 See the Chapter 2 and following Chapters for a description of the lines in question. \n11 For example, the Greensboro station described in Chapter 6. \n 1-5\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \nChapter 2 \nTHE CORRIDOR TODAY \nCorridor Location, Population, and Marketing Factors \nGeneral Location \nThe designated Southeast Corridor1 would link the Northeast Corridor, Washington, \nD.C., Richmond, Virginia, and Raleigh, North Carolina with Savannah, Georgia and \nJacksonville, Florida, via two routes between Raleigh and Savannah: westerly, via Charlotte, \nNorth Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia; and easterly, via Columbia, South Carolina.

Other ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù routes are possible. \nThe S Line is assumed, for analytical purposes, to be the route between Richmond \nand Raleigh because‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ It is 35 miles shorter than the A Line; \n‚Ä¢ It would provide a significantly shorter trip time; \n‚Ä¢ It would optimize operating flexibility; \n‚Ä¢ Based on environmental studies to date, it would appear to require minimal \nenvironmental mitigation; and \n‚Ä¢ It would maximize the reliability and capacity of the intercity passenger and \nfreight services proposed for the year 2020. \nThe A Line route option has the further disadvantages of: \n‚Ä¢ An alignment on the connecting link between Selma and Raleigh that has \nnumerous sharp curves and steep grades; and \n‚Ä¢ Since it is the primary north-south CSXT freight corridor paralleling I-95: \n‚Äì  Significant segments of double and triple-track would be required to \naccommodate the projected freight train, high-speed train service, and \nAmtrak Florida service6; \n‚Äì  A second A Line bridge over the Appomattox River would have to be \nconstructed.  Any such second A Line bridge would require a complex \nalignment modification at both ends of the structure and would have to be \nconstructed sufficiently west of the existing bridge not to disturb its \nsubstructure. Instead, a single-track bridge for the S Line would be \nconstructed approximately 1800 feet west of the existing A Line Bridge; and \n‚Äì  Locations, such as Collier, south of Petersburg, would have numerous trains \nstopping to set off and pick up freight cars at major yards.   \nThe former Burgess Cutoff ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù route has the following disadvantages: \n \n5 In the 19th Century, the term ‚ÄúAir Line‚Äù was used in the name of a number of railroads to imply that their route was more \ndirect than that of their competitors. The SAL was the last surviving major railroad to use this term in its corporate title; in \nthe case of the Richmond‚ÄìRaleigh route, the term ‚ÄúAir Line‚Äù was properly applied. \n6 Chapter 6, in its discussion of the Greensboro‚ÄìCharlotte segment of the Corridor, describes the extensive \ninvestments (including double- and triple-tracking) required to reliably accommodate high-speed rail service \non an existing heavily-trafficked freight line.  Unlike the Richmond‚ÄìRaleigh situation, no practical alternative \nroute is available in the case of Greensboro‚ÄìCharlotte. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-5\n‚Ä¢ It is 5.9 miles longer than the S Line route; \n‚Ä¢ A second A Line bridge over the Appomattox River would have to be \nconstructed; and \n‚Ä¢ Collier Yard, south of Petersburg, would have trains stopping to set off and pick \nup freight cars. \nThe S Line‚Äôs operating advantages would be particularly apparent in the presence of \nthe other improvements contemplated in this monograph.   \nBackground \nTwo of the earliest rail lines in North Carolina and Virginia form the nucleus of the \nRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor.  The segment from Raleigh to Norlina was part of the \nRaleigh & Gaston, chartered in 1835 and completed in 1840, to gain access to Portsmouth, \nVirginia by connecting to another line near Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina.  The North \nCarolina Railroad (NCRR) was incorporated in 1849 and construction began westward from \nGoldsboro.  Together with the Atlantic & East Carolina, it formed a continuous route from \nthe Atlantic Ocean, at Morehead City, to Charlotte, via Raleigh and Greensboro.   \nThe Raleigh & Gaston Railroad became part of the SAL, which was a predecessor of \ntoday‚Äôs CSXT rail system.  The Richmond, Petersburg & Carolina Railroad was chartered in \n1882 to connect Richmond and Petersburg with the Raleigh & Gaston at Ridgeway Junction, \nNorth Carolina, now known as Norlina.  Construction did not begin until 1897, and reached \ncompletion in May 1900.  Together, these two railroads formed the route from Richmond to \nRaleigh (the S Line).   \nThe NCRR, which is still owned by the State, was leased in 1896 to the Southern \nRailway, a predecessor of today‚Äôs Norfolk Southern, and was incorporated into the \nSouthern‚Äôs operations.  Over the years it evolved differently east and west of Greensboro.  \nTo the west, it became part of the Southern‚Äôs main line between Washington, DC and New \nOrleans, via Atlanta, Georgia, a relatively high-density freight route that once carried a \nsignificant number of intercity passenger trains.  Owing to these heavy densities, the line \nsouth of Greensboro benefited over the years from a number of improvements, including \nline relocations and capacity expansions.  Although double-tracked throughout by the mid-\n20th Century, the Greensboro-Charlotte route reverted in part to single-track status during \nthat century‚Äôs final decades as the operating freight railroad sought to maximize asset \nutilization and reduce maintenance expenses. \nEast of Greensboro, the NCRR remained a secondary main line under Southern \nRailway (now NS) operation.  It received no automatic signal system or any significant \nimprovements to the alignment.  The single track still follows the landscape, much as it did \nwhen originally built. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-6\n                                                \nLength and Ownership \nThe Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor extends for 332 miles between Main Street \nStation, Richmond, and a relocated Charlotte Station. In addition, this study assumes a \nseven-mile extension from Charlotte south to the Charlotte Airport, for a total of 338 miles. \nThe primary owners of the Corridor are CSXT and NCRR. \nAs a result of the divergent ownership and control, the study corridor is divided at \nRaleigh, currently and historically, into two separate segments, one operated by CSXT (the \nS Line), the other operated by NS.7  In character and physical development, the NCRR is \nfurther divided at Greensboro between the main line route south to Charlotte (the P Line), \nand the secondary route east to Raleigh (the H Line).  At Norlina, the CSXT portion is \ndivided into a light-density local line south to Raleigh, and an abandoned right of way north \nto Centralia. \nThe current ownership and use of the abandoned portion of the S Line between \nCentralia and Norlina would influence the cost and timing of the contemplated \nimprovements. As indicated in Appendix E, the line is not intact: anecdotal reports suggest \nthat scattered segments of the S Line have been conveyed to various public and private \nentities.  Determining precisely the status of the abandoned portion of the S Line would \nrequire intensive field work and title searches and, accordingly, was beyond the scope of \nthis study.8  \nA summary of current track ownership by corridor segment is presented in Table 2-\n2.   \nTrackage and Track Conditions \nRichmond (Main Street)‚ÄìCentralia \nThe line, known as the Bellwood Subdivision of the S Line, has two tracks except \nfor a single-track bridge over the James River, and a short singe-track segment in advance of \nCentralia Interlocking. CSXT, the owner/operator, has maintained the segment in a \ncondition satisfactory for the current designated operating speed class.  Passenger trains \npresently do not operate over the line. \n \n \n7 See below, at page 2-8 and footnote 12, for a discussion of the parallel NS and CSXT operation from Raleigh \nwest to Fetner. \n8 This analysis did not attempt to include real estate acquisitions in the cost of the identified improvements; see \nChapter 7. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-7\nTable 2-2: Track Ownership and Operating Control \nMilepost9\nRoute-\nMiles Locations \nOwner and \n(Operator) if \ndifferent Dispatched From \nS0.0 ‚Äì S10.7 10.7 Main Street Station ‚Äì Centralia CSXT Jacksonville, FL \nS10.7 ‚Äì S98.2 87.5 Centralia ‚Äì Norlina Abandoned.

In the 1950s, when the line was active, short11 \npassing sidings were located four to five miles apart at Lynch, Ryan, Burgess, Dinwiddie, \nDe Witt, McKenney, Rawlings, Warfield, Alberta, Grandy, Skelton, La Crosse, Hagood, \nBracey, Paschall, and Norlina. \nAlternative routes from Centralia through Petersburg to Burgess have been devised \nusing combinations of the old ACL and new passenger mains through downtown Petersburg \nwith connections to the A and S lines west of Petersburg.  The VDRPT‚Äôs Richmond to \nSouth Hampton Roads High-Speed Rail Feasibility Study presently is evaluating these \nalternative routes because they could provide connections between Richmond, Petersburg, \nand Norfolk. Chapter 6 of this report describes these Petersburg options as they pertain to \nthe Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor. \nNorlina‚ÄìRaleigh \nThe remainder of the S Line between Norlina and Raleigh has been downgraded to a \nfreight-only branch.  The line is single-track with short sidings (at Greystone, Henderson, \nand Youngsville) to enable trains to pass each other and serve local industries. Previously, \n                                                 \n9 Three milepost numbering systems are in use on the assumed route of the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte corridor; \nthese reflect the patchwork history and disparate ownership of the line:  \nMilepost numbers prefixed by‚éØ ‚éØRefer to: \nS S Line, Main Street Station to Raleigh \nH North Carolina Railroad between Raleigh and Greensboro \nP North Carolina Railroad  (operated as an NS main line), \nGreensboro‚ÄìCharlotte \n \n10 As Chapter 4 states, this characterization of today‚Äôs S Line reflects the limited on-site inspections that were \npossible within this study‚Äôs scope.  Fuller information on the S Line‚Äôs current status would emerge as the \nengineering work becomes more detailed. \n11 The sidings generally were one to two miles in length. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-8\n                                                \nthe line was double-tracked between Neuse (S147.4) and Crabtree (S153.8), and additional \nsidings were located at Middleburg, Gill, Kittrell, Franklinton, Wake Forest, and Raleigh. \nRaleigh‚ÄìGreensboro \nThe NCRR owns the 81-mile line segment, termed the ‚ÄúH Line,‚Äù between Raleigh \nand Greensboro. The eight-mile portion of the line between Raleigh and Cary (Fetner \nInterlocking) consists of two adjacent single-track lines used by NS and CSXT and \ndispatched by CSXT. 12 The CSXT-operated track crosses the NS-maintained track at Fetner \nInterlocking to access CSXT‚Äôs Aberdeen Subdivision to Hamlet. The remainder of the line \nto Greensboro is single-track territory with passing sidings; its sole freight operator is NS. \nThe alignment has numerous sharp curves, steep grades, and grade crossings. The \ncontrolling grade is 1.16 percent, between mileposts H38 and H39.  Train performance \ncalculator (TPC) simulations suggest that freight trains ascending this grade could slow to as \nlow as 11 mph. The line passes through numerous cities and small towns, Durham being the \nprincipal intermediate city.  \nExisting sidings are located at Durham, Funston, Efland, Mebane, and McLeansville. \nThe sidings are short, normally less than two miles, and are accessed through hand-thrown \nswitches, operated with permission from the dispatcher. \nLack of a signal system limits the existing maximum authorized speeds (MAS‚Äôs) for \nAmtrak passenger trains to 59 mph and 49 mph for freight trains. There are numerous slow-\nspeed areas as the result of curvature and grade crossings.   \nGreensboro‚ÄìCharlotte \nThe Greensboro‚ÄìCharlotte portion of the Southeast Corridor is the most critical \nsection of the entire Corridor, from the viewpoint of traffic density and bottlenecks.  \nCapacity improvements would be needed here if the States‚Äô goals‚éØparticularly the \nreliability goals‚éØof intercity passenger trains and NS freight trains are to be effected. \nThe NCRR owns the NS‚Äôs important Washington‚ÄìAtlanta ‚ÄúPiedmont Main Line‚Äù \nfrom MP 283.9 in Greensboro to MP 375.4, at the north end of the present Charlotte Station. \nNS leases this portion of the line, and owns the line from MP 375.4 southward. The \nalignment is relatively straight; the curvature and gradient are not as sharp and steep as \nthose of the H Line. Grade crossings are numerous. The line originally was double-\ntracked13; however, over one-third of the P Line has been single-tracked. The existing \nsingle-track segments, totaling 35 miles, are located between: \n‚Ä¢ Cox and Hoskins - 8.7 miles, \n‚Ä¢ Bowers and Lake ‚Äì 4.2 miles, \n \n12 In September 2000, CSXT filed a Declaratory Judgment against the NCRR regarding a portion of the right-\nof-way between Raleigh and Cary, in which CSXT claimed to have a property ownership interest.  In \nDecember 2001, the NCRR and CSXT resolved that dispute so as to acknowledge the NCRR‚Äôs ownership of, \nand CSXT‚Äôs right to use, the segment in question.  Pertinent details appear in the NCRR‚Äôs press release, in the \nSupplement at the end of this volume. (Source: http://www.ncrr.com/news/121001news.htm.) \n13 Segments of additional track and sidings were provided in the vicinity of yards and critical locations. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-9\n                                                \n‚Ä¢ Reed and North Kannapolis ‚Äì 10.0 miles, and \n‚Ä¢ Haydock and Junker ‚Äì 12.1 miles. \nThe single-track segments are accessed through power-operated switches controlled \nby the dispatcher. \nCurrently, the MAS for passenger trains is 79 mph (50 to 60 mph for freight trains, \ndepending on type). There are numerous slow-speed areas as the result of curvature and \ngrade crossings. \nSignaling  \nThe condition of the pole line on the CSXT Bellwood Subdivision between Centralia \nand Richmond is poor, and the entire 60-year old signal system needs upgrading. The signal \nsystem between Centralia and Edgeton, a crossing with NS in north Raleigh, was removed \nprior to the cessation of service north of Norlina. From Edgeton to Fetner, the CSXT \nAberdeen Subdivision is signaled. The parallel NCRR between Boylan Ave and Fetner is \ncontrolled by CSXT signals. From Fetner up to and not including Greensboro, the H Line \nhas no signals14 except for grade crossing warning devices. The NCRR between Greensboro \nand Charlotte is signaled. The average age of the NS signal system between Greensboro and \nCharlotte is less than 30 years.15 Cab signaling is not installed on any portion of the line. \nHighway-Railroad Grade Crossings   \nLike most other corridors, the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte route houses a large number of \npublic and private highway-rail grade crossings.  Fortunately, the States involved have \nalready begun to take noteworthy action overcome the attendant safety hazards. \nCrossing Inventory \nIn total, there are 448 public and private crossings between Richmond and Charlotte; \nthis count includes some 78 former public and private grade crossing sites on the currently-\nabandoned portion of the S Line.16  The incidence of crossings by segment is summarized in \nTable 2-3. \nAt a minimum, all the public crossings are protected by crossbucks. Various \ncombinations of flashing lights, gates, and ringing bells are installed at these crossings.  \n \n14 As this monograph went to press, the State of North Carolina and the NS were cooperatively upgrading the \nNCRR between Greensboro and Fetner with wayside signaling, Centralized Traffic Control, and siding \nimprovements. \n15 Study of Signal and Train Control System Improvements, Washington, D.C. to Charlotte, N.C. High-Speed \nCorridor, DRPT #98-02, Thomas K. Dyer, Inc. \n16 If these former S line crossing sites are ignored, there are 296 public and 74 private crossings in service, for \na total of 370. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-10\nOngoing Crossing Safety Initiatives \nBoth North Carolina and Virginia are in the forefront of States actively addressing \nsafety issues at highway-rail grade crossings. \nThe VDRPT has an ongoing program to identify crossings that can either be: \n‚Ä¢ Eliminated, through closure;  \n‚Ä¢ Separated, through construction of a bridge or underpass; or \n‚Ä¢ Improved, through the installation of more extensive and more highly \nvisible protection devices.   \nTable 2-3: Existing Highway-Rail Grade Crossings in Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor \n[NOTE: ‚ÄúExisting‚Äù includes former crossings on abandoned S Line, Centralia‚ÄìPetersburg‚ÄìNorlina] \nSegment Line Miles \nNumber of \nPublic \nCrossings \nPublic \nCrossings \nper Mile \nNumber of \nPrivate \nCrossings \nPrivate \nCrossings \nper Mile \nTotal \nCrossings \nTotal \nCrossings \nper Mile \nRichmond‚ÄìCentralia  Active S 10.7 10 0.9 1 0.1 11 1.0 \nCentralia‚ÄìPetersburg‚Äì\nNorlina17\nAban-\ndoned \nS \n87.5 58 0.7 20 0.2 78 0.9 \nNorlina‚ÄìRaleigh Active S 59.2 69 1.2 31 0.5 100 1.7 \nRaleigh‚Äì Greensboro H 80.6 110 1.4 21 0.3 131 1.6 \nGreensboro‚ÄìCharlotte18 P 100.4 107 1.1 21 0.2 128 1.3 \nTotals, Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte \nCorridor19   338.4 354 1.0 94 0.3 448 1.3 \n \nVirginia has received about $4 million under Section 1010 of ISTEA for high-speed \nrail grade crossing improvements, and is eligible for additional funding under TEA 21 \nsection 1103(c). Completed and planned grade crossing improvements north of Richmond to \ndate include construction of a pedestrian bridge and new roadway bridge at Featherstone in \nPrince William County, and the provision of Constant Warning Time systems at crossings. \nIn a nationally-recognized program, the NCDOT Rail Division and NS began \nworking together in 1994 to \"seal\"‚éØor separate the vehicular and rail traffic on‚éØthe NCRR \ncorridor between Raleigh, Greensboro and Charlotte.  Aided by Federal funding under the \nISTEA and TEA-21 specialized high-speed rail grade crossing programs and the Next \nGeneration High-Speed Rail Program, this Sealed Corridor Initiative aims at improving or \n                                                 \n17 All inventories and projections for the now-abandoned portion of the S Line are based on limited field \ninvestigations of crossings that existed when the line was in service. With regard to private crossings:  In total, \n32 sites exist where private crossings once carried vehicular traffic; of these, the limited field investigations \nsuggest that some three-fifths, or 20 sites, would be active today had the railroad remained in operation.  All \ncrossing conditions and needs would require detailed investigation, verification, and analysis should the States \nproceed with corridor development. \n18 Figures for \"Greensboro-Charlotte\" include Charlotte Airport. \n19 Includes crossings that formerly existed on the now-abandoned S Line \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-11\n                                                \nclosing every crossing along the North Carolina portion of the Southeast Corridor, thus \nhelping to ensure safe high speed operation along the line. NCDOT has developed a \ncomprehensive strategy for treating the different types of crossings across the route, with \ncreative solutions including four-quadrant gates, longer gate arms, inexpensive median \nbarriers, and video enforcement. Video surveillance at specific unimproved and improved \ncrossings has proven that advanced highway-rail crossing protection systems, such as four-\nquadrant gates and median barriers, reduce driver \"run-around\" violations by as much as 98 \npercent and thus significantly reduce the risk of train/auto collisions. 20  CSXT also is \ninvolved in a segment of the corridor between Raleigh and Cary. \nThe Sealed Corridor Initiative serves as a model for grade crossing hazard \nelimination. With its program of technology installation, testing, and assessment, the \nInitiative is a prime example of a cost-effective, comprehensive, corridor-wide grade \ncrossing treatment. This experiment has provided useful information to the FRA, the \nFHWA, and the other States as they work to enhance grade crossing safety on other \nemerging corridors. \nThe Section 1103(c) program under the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st \nCentury contains provisions for special Federal assistance for upgrading safety on highway-\nrailroad crossings in designated high-speed rail corridors like the Southeast Corridor.  \nSubject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that the two States will continue their \npast use of that program (as well as other Federal-aid highway grade crossing funding \nprograms and State, local, and other funding sources) to address crossing issues on this \nCorridor.    \nStations   \nAmtrak, as the existing passenger service provider in the Corridor, and the States are \nnormally responsible for the condition and level of service of the Corridor's stations. As \npassenger rail traffic declined after World War II, stations lost their perceived importance as \nlinks to the transportation system and by the 1960s many stations in North Carolina and \nVirginia were run down, closed, or had been demolished. In the 1990s, the North Carolina \nDepartment of Transportation and Amtrak began the Carolinian (Charlotte‚ÄìRaleigh‚Äì\nRichmond‚ÄìWashington‚ÄìNew York) and Piedmont (Charlotte‚ÄìRaleigh) trains, dramatically \nboosting rail travel in the state. As passenger train travel grows in popularity, historic \nstations are being rehabilitated or new stations are being planned to provide better \ntransportation and economic growth for communities. \nStation siting, parking, intermodal connections, highway access, adequate station \nwaiting and ticketing facilities, platform length and width, signage, and Americans With \nDisabilities Act (ADA) requirements are among the many considerations that require \nattention as part of the initiation of upgraded intercity passenger service. In particular, given \nthe dispersion of the population within cities, suburbs, and rural areas, adequate access from \n \n20 For further details on this successful program, see http://www.bytrain.org/safety/sealed.html . \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-12\ninterstate and main highways and sufficient parking to support projected demands would be \nessential to encouraging increased use of the intercity rail network, should the States wish to \ndo so.  \nMarketing considerations and evident local preferences dictated this study‚Äôs \nassumptions regarding the provision of certain new and relocated station facilities.  In most \ncases, as described in Chapters 5 and 6, this study did not deal with station buildings and \nparking needs, but focused on track rearrangements and accompanying passenger platforms \nand access.  Consequently, programs to upgrade building facilities and parking to meet 2020 \nneeds are generally omitted from this monograph.  \nTypical of railway station redevelopment programs around the country is the \nongoing effort to re-institute rail passenger service into Main Street Station, Richmond.  As \npart of this program, the station will become part of the Richmond Multi-modal \nTransportation Center (RMTC). Similar intermodal efforts to revitalize or relocate stations \nat other major points could become an integral part of development of the Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte Corridor. \nAn inventory of station ownership appears in Table 2-3. \n \nTable 2-4: Station Ownership and Use \n[For existing stations, status is as of February 2001.] \n   Owner \nMilepost21 Location User Land Station Parking \nExisting Stations \nS0 Richmond - Main Street Station Amtrak  City of Richmond \nS22.0 Petersburg (Ettrick) Amtrak CSXT (leased to Amtrak) \nH81.2 Raleigh Amtrak NCRR \nH72.7 Cary Amtrak City of Cary City and NCRR \nH54.8 Durham Amtrak NCRR NCDOT NCRR \nH21.5 Burlington Amtrak NCRR NCDOT NCRR \nP286.8 Greensboro Amtrak NCRR NS NCRR \nP299.2 High Point Amtrak NCRR \nP333.3 Salisbury Amtrak Historic Salisbury Foundation, Inc. \nP348.9 Kannapolis Amtrak NCRR Disputed NCRR \nP376.0 Charlotte Amtrak NS \n \n                                                 \n21 Stations to be relocated will show different milepost numbers in Table 5-3. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nUsers and Services \nThe Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor currently carries a variety of intercity passenger \nand freight services.  No commuter services operate at present between Richmond and \nCharlotte (see Chapter 3 for possible future commuter operations).  Current service levels \nfor all rail traffic types appear in Table 2-5. \nIntercity Rail Passenger Service \n \nAll intercity passenger trains in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor are currently \noperated by Amtrak, either on its own account or through a contractual relationship with \nother sponsors.  The relationships of the operator and sponsors to the track owners are \nestablished in operating agreements.  The pertinent agreements are summarized in Appendix \nE.  \n \nCorridor Services \nThe State of North Carolina sponsors and financially supports two Amtrak-operated \npassenger trains serving the State: \nFigure 2-4: Intercity Rail Passenger Service  \nThrough North Carolina22  \n \n‚Ä¢ the Piedmont (shown as a white line in Figure 2-4), which operates a \ndaily round trip between Raleigh and Charlotte; and \n‚Ä¢ the Carolinian (shown in black in Figure 2-4), which operates a daily \nround trip between New York and Charlotte.  \n                                                 \n22 Adopted from map provided by NCDOT Rail Division at its site Hhttp://www.bytrain.org/highspeed/H .  \n 2-13\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-14\nTable 2-5: Existing Railroad Services on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor \nNumber of Daily Train Movements Year 2001, by Segment \n(Round Trips Count as Two Movements.) \n(Movements Under 10 Miles in Length are Omitted.) \nType of Service \nWashington‚Äì\nRichmond\n(Note A) N\not\ne \nRichmond \n‚ÄìCentralia\n(Note O)  N\not\ne \nCentralia‚Äì\nRaleigh\n(Note M)  N\not\ne Raleigh - \nGreensboro  N\not\ne \nGreensboro \n- Spencer \nYard  N\not\ne \nSpencer \nYard‚Äì\nCharlotte N\not\ne \nIntercity Passenger             \nCorridor-type services             \nNortheast Corridor‚ÄìCharlotte 2  2  0  2  2  2  \nRaleigh‚ÄìCharlotte 0  0  0  2  2  2  \nOther Virginia services 8 B 0 N 0  0  0  0  \nTotal, Corridor-type services 10  2  0  4  4  4  \nLong-distance services             \nNortheast Corridor‚ÄìFlorida (Note J) 6  6  0  0 J 0  0  \nNortheast Corridor‚ÄìAtlanta (Note D) 0 D 0  0  0  2 C 2 C\nLorton, Virginia‚ÄìFlorida AutoTrain 2  2  0  0  0  0  \nTotal, Long-distance services 8  8  0  0  2  2  \nTotal Intercity Passenger 18  10 O 0  4  6  6  \nCommuter             \nVirginia Railway Express 14 E 0  0  0  0  0  \nConcord - Charlotte 0  0  0  0  0  0 F\nTotal, Commuter 14  0  0  0  0  0  \nFreight             \nTotal freight services,  \nCSXT and NS (Note G) 24 H 24 O 4 I 8 K 26  24 L\nTotal, Charlotte-Richmond Corridor 56  34  4  12 J, K 32  30  \nNote A Statistics for the Washington‚ÄìRichmond segment are provided for information only, as that segment is not part of the focus of this monograph.

The Piedmont follows the same path between Raleigh and points \nwest and south.  Schedules for these two services appear in Figure 2-5. \nLong-Distance Services \nAlso making use of a segment of the study corridor (between Greensboro and \nCharlotte) is the Crescent. Operating a daily round trip between New York and New \nOrleans, the Crescent cannot provide a corridor-type service in North Carolina as it crosses \nthe State in the middle of the night in both \ndirections.

For current \nschedules, readers should contact Amtrak. \n \nTwo daily Amtrak Florida round trip \nservices‚éØthe Silver Meteor and the Silver \nPalm‚éØserve Richmond (Staples Mill Road) \nand Petersburg, Virginia, and Rocky Mount, \nWilson, Selma, and Fayetteville, North \nCarolina, all via the A Line.  This is the \neasternmost north/south route in Figure 2-4.24  \nA third Amtrak Florida round trip, the \nSilver Star, currently takes the same A Line \nRoute between Richmond (Staples Mill \nRoad), Petersburg, Rocky Mount, Wilson, \nand Selma, then diverts westward over the H \nLine to Raleigh and Cary, thence southward \nvia CSXT‚Äôs active S Line to Hamlet, North \nCarolina, and Columbia, South Carolina.25  \nThe Auto Train, a specialized service \ncarrying passengers and their motor vehicles \nfrom northern Virginia to and from Florida, \noperates a daily round trip via the A Line \nthrough Richmond (Staples Mill Road) and \nPetersburg, but does not stop within the \nCorridor.26   \n \n2-15 \n                                                 \n23 From Amtrak‚Äôs Spring/Summer 2001 Timetable, page 38. \n24 As described in Chapter 3, these A Line trains are assumed to continue their present routing into the future, \nexcept that in the Richmond/Petersburg area they would operate from Staples Mill Road through Main Street, \nthence via the S Line to Centralia, where they would resume their current A Line routing. \n25 See Chapter 3: in the future, the Silver Star is projected to operate via Main Street Station, Richmond, \nthence the S Line via Centralia, Norlina, Raleigh, Hamlet, and Columbia. \n26 See Chapter 3: in the future, the Auto Train is assumed to continue to operate, without passenger stops, on \nits present A Line routing due to clearance limitations at Main Street Station. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-16\n                                                \n \nFreight \nThe level of freight service‚éØincluding through freight trains, locals, and coal \ntrains‚éØvaries by segment. 27  Over the Corridor taken as a whole, most freight trains \nprovide general merchandise and intermodal service. \nRichmond is a principal CSXT freight hub.  On average, twenty-four daily CSXT \nfreight movements operate on all routes between Richmond and Centralia.28 The total \nrepresents a combination of: \n‚Ä¢ Freight trains that operate through Main Street Station to and from Centralia on the S \nLine (most of these are en route between the former Chesapeake & Ohio line via \nCharlottesville, and points on the former SAL and ACL south of Richmond); \n‚Ä¢ Local freight trains that provide service to industries adjacent to the S Line; and \n‚Ä¢ CSXT freight trains that operate between Acca Yard, north of Richmond, through \nCentralia, to Petersburg on the A Line, CSXT‚Äôs main north-south freight route \nparalleling I-95. \nOn the surviving S Line segment between Norlina and Raleigh, CSXT operates four \nlocal freight train movements a day. Four CSXT freight movements also traverse the 8.4-\nmile NCRR segment between Raleigh and Fetner, where CSXT‚Äôs Aberdeen subdivision \ndiverges to the southwest, toward Hamlet, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina. \nNS and CSXT maintain separate yard operations in Raleigh.29  On the P Line, NS \nhas yards at Greensboro (‚ÄúPomona‚Äù), north of Salisbury (Spencer Yard in Linwood), and \nCharlotte. NS, the primary user of the H Line, operates eight daily freight trains between \nRaleigh and either Pomona or Spencer Yard.  NS also serves local shippers on the H Line \nand Piedmont Main Line. \nPresently, approximately 31 NS freight movements per day operate on the busiest \nfreight segment‚éØthe Piedmont Main Line between Greensboro and Charlotte.  \n \n27 Throughout this section, the count of freight trains is the average daily total number of runs operated \nregardless of direction.  The number of nortbound movements plus the number of southbound movements \nyields the count.  This is a realistic way of depicting freight activity, since it recognizes that directional \nimbalances are typical of freight movements.  For comparability among services, the same counting method is \napplied across-the-board to all rail operations in the summary Table 2-5. \n \n28 The high level of traffic on the A Line through Centralia and Petersburg has, in part, driven the assumption \nthat the S Line between Centralia, Petersburg, and Norlina would be restored for passenger service.   \n29 NS‚Äôs facility is called Glenwood Yard.  \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nExisting Service Quality \nAt the time this analysis was completed, the maximum authorized speed for \npassenger trains in the corridor varied by location, as specified in the CSX and NS \nEmployee Timetables, and peaked at 79 mph.30   \nIntercity passenger services in North Carolina, as well as NS freight operations \nbetween Greensboro and Charlotte, are incurring substantial delays on a regular basis. In \nparticular, NCDOT intercity passenger train delays are substantial, with on-time \nperformance over the past four years ranging between 60 and 70 percent (Figure 2-6). \nFigure 2-6: On-Time Performance of  \nCarolinian and Piedmont, 1998-200131\n 67.4 %\n63.7% \n66.3% 64.1%\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nFY 1998 FY 1999 FY 2000 FY 2001\n \n \nThese delays indicate that even now, with passenger traffic not fully developed, the \nRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor presents some inherent challenges to reliable operations.  \nTypical challenges include the following: \n‚Ä¢ The H Line between Cary and Greensboro lacks automatic block signals; \ntheir absence restricts passenger train speeds to 59 mph, by Federal law.  \n 2-17\n                                                 \n30 The State of North Carolina, in collaboration with the North Carolina Railroad and the NS, in mid-2002 \nannounced service improvements resulting from its systematic program of investments in the North Carolina \nportions of the Corridor.  These improvements, involving higher train speed limits, are described in an article, \n‚ÄúTrain speeds to increase between Durham and Charlotte,‚Äù reproduced in the ‚ÄúSupplement: Background \nMaterials‚Äù at the end of this volume. \n31 These are Amtrak‚Äôs fiscal years, ending on September 30 of the year named.

The lack of any kind of traffic control system \nrequires train service employees to stop trains and manually throw switches \nto enter and exit sidings, and results in a minimum of a 15-minute delay for \neach meet with another train.  \n‚Ä¢ The Piedmont Main Line between Greensboro and Charlotte is double-\ntracked, except for four segments of single track.33 The route is equipped \nwith automatic block signals and has an MAS of 79 mph, which is the ceiling \non MAS established by Federal law for territory without cab signaling.  \nFreight trains currently use the main tracks at Pomona Yard (Greensboro) \nand Charlotte Yard to set off and pick up cars. These operations consume \ntrack capacity and result in conflicts with other trains.  Northbound freights \nthat are unable to leave the main line and enter the Pomona Yard facility are \nheld on the single-track segment south of Cox Interlocking, further \nconsuming capacity. \nAs a practical result of these challenges, conflicts between freight and intercity \npassenger operations are occurring every day, as expressed in Figure 2-6.  As a result, the \nNCDOT (in cooperation with NCRR and NS) is implementing a short-term program to \naddress some of the capacity and operating issues on this State-owned facility‚éØfor \nexample, by installing some signaling and train control.   The immediate result of this \nprogram is intended to be more reliable passenger operations with no degradation in freight \nservice.34     \nFor the long term, these freight and passenger capacity and service issues reinforce \nthe need for a careful scrutiny of the line‚Äôs capabilities, needs, and future traffic potentials, \nin light of evolving plans for high-speed passenger service.  The balance of this report treats \nthese issues at length. \nAreas of Special Complexity  \nThis study has identified five areas of special complexity in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte \nCorridor: \n‚Ä¢ Richmond/Petersburg; \n‚Ä¢ Raleigh; \n‚Ä¢ Greensboro/Pomona Yard; \n \n32 A track warrant, issued by the train dispatcher, authorizes a train or engine to occupy the main track within \ndesignated limits. \n33 Details are on page 2-8. \n34 Further information on this short-term program appears in the Supplement: Background Materials at the end \nof this volume, under the heading ‚ÄúService Improvements on North Carolina Portions of SEC.‚Äù \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n 2-19\n‚Ä¢ Salisbury/Spencer Yard; and \n‚Ä¢ Charlotte. \nThe physical and operational complexity of these regions stems largely from their \nstatus as junctions among important freight routes, some of which would also serve a heavy \npassenger traffic under this monograph‚Äôs assumptions.  Nor are ‚Äúfreight‚Äù and ‚Äúpassenger‚Äù \nmovements, respectively, homogeneous: heavy coal trains, trains of empty cars returning to \nmining districts, merchandise trains, local pick-up and delivery runs, and intermodal freights \nhave diverse track capacity requirements, performance capabilities, routings, and \npredictability characteristics, just as do the overnight, corridor, and commuter movements \nlumped together as ‚Äúpassenger‚Äù trains.  Table 2-6 illustrates the variety of rail operations in \nthe areas of special complexity.  Particulars appear in Chapter 6, which explains the \noperating rationale for the various improvement projects contemplated in this monograph. \n \n \nTable 2-6: Inventory of Operations in ‚ÄúAreas of Special Complexity‚Äù35\nNS Freight CSXT Freight Intercity  Passenger \nArea of \nSpecial \nComplexity \nM\nai\nn \nL\nin\ne \nFr\nei\ngh\nt \nA\ndd\niti\non\nal\n \nC\non\nve\nrg\nin\ng \nL\nin\nes\n \nY\nar\nd \nO\npe\nra\ntio\nns\n \nM\nai\nn \nL\nin\ne \nFr\nei\ngh\nt \nA\ndd\niti\non\nal\n \nC\non\nve\nrg\nin\ng \nL\nin\nes\n \nY\nar\nd \nO\npe\nra\ntio\nns\n \nC\nor\nri\ndo\nr \nO\nve\nrn\nig\nht\n Commuter36\nRichmond ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  \nRaleigh ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  \nGreensboro ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢    ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  \nSalisbury ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢    ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ \nCharlotte ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ \n \n                                                 \n35 Only substantial yard operations are indicated.  \n36 Projected service on the general system of railroads. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nFigures in Chapter 2 \nFigure 2-1: The Southeast Corridor in Context ..................................................................................2-1 \nFigure 2-2: Southeast Corridor Portion Addressed in This Study (Assumed ‚ÄúS Line‚Äù Route is \nShown).......................................................................................................................................2-2 \nFigure 2-3: Spatial Distribution of Population in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor ........................2-3 \nFigure 2-4: Intercity Rail Passenger Service  Through North Carolina ...........................................2-13 \nFigure 2-5: Typical Amtrak Schedules  in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor ................................2-15 \nFigure 2-6: On-Time Performance of  Carolinian and Piedmont, 1998-2001 .................................2-17 \n \nTables in Chapter 2 \nTTable 2-1: City-Pair Markets and Mileages Within the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor..................2-2 \nTable 2-2: Track Ownership and Operating Control..........................................................................2-7 \nTable 2-3: Existing Highway-Rail Grade Crossings in Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor...................2-10 \nTable 2-4: Station Ownership and Use.............................................................................................2-12 \nTable 2-5: Existing Railroad Services on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor..................................2-14 \nTable 2-6: Inventory of Operations in ‚ÄúAreas of Special Complexity‚Äù ...........................................2-19 \n \n \n \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n  \nChapter 3 \nSERVICE GOALS \nAll operators and sponsors‚éØintercity passenger, commuter, and freight‚éØintend the \nservices on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor in the planning year, 2020, to be more reliable \nthan those operating on the Corridor at present; this study has adopted 90 percent on-time \nperformance as a planning goal.1  North Carolina and Virginia envision train service reliably \nlinking Richmond (Main Street Station) and Charlotte (at a new station to be constructed in the \nvicinity of West 4th Street) in four hours and twenty-five minutes by 2020, with five \nintermediate stops.2  The projected 2020 freight, passenger, and commuter schedules are \ncontained in Appendix F, summarized in Table 3-1, and described below.  \nThe simple number of daily trains envisioned in Table 3-1 for a typical 24-hour period \ndoes not adequately depict the potential congestion on the Corridor. Intercity passenger trains are \nconcentrated into an 18- rather than a 24-hour day, since operations between midnight and 6:00 \na.m. are minimal; commuter trains have even more pronounced peaks.  Thus, to assess the \npotential for congestion requires analysis of the complex interactions of through freight, local \nfreight, and passenger trains in single and double-track portions of the corridor over a typical \nday‚éØindeed, over an entire typical week. Such an analysis was essential to this study and is \ndescribed in Chapter 4.  \nIntercity Passenger \nCorridor-Type Services \nStudies prepared for the State of North Carolina project a significant demand for intercity \nrail travel on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor by the year 2020 if high-speed rail service were \nto be implemented.  FRA‚Äôs Commercial Feasibility Study, High-Speed Ground Transportation \nfor America, also projected a marked growth in intercity rail travel demand for the Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte Corridor as part of a Washington‚ÄìRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte Southeast Corridor.3 Both \nstudies assumed through service between Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, and New York. \n \n                                                 \n1 This would mean 90 percent of trains would arrive on or before their scheduled time, precisely. See Chapter 4. \n2 Service between the restored Main Street Station and Washington Union Station is projected to take less than two \nhours with three intermediate stations. \n3 FRA 1997, chapter 8.  When that report was prepared, the Southeast Corridor had not been extended to Atlanta and \nother points south. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n  3-2 \nTable 3-1: Railroad Services Envisioned for 2020 in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor \nNumber of Projected Daily Train Movements, Year 2020, by Segment \n(Round Trips Count as Two Movements.) \n(Movements Under 10 Miles in Length are Omitted.)  \nType of Service \nWashington‚Äì \nRichmond \n(Note A)  N\not\ne \nRichmond \n(Main Street) \n‚Äì Centralia\n(Note M)  N\not\ne Centralia‚Äì \nRaleigh  N\not\ne Raleigh‚Äì\nGreensboro  N\not\ne \nGreensboro \n‚ÄìSpencer \nYard  N\not\ne \nSpencer \nYard \n ‚ÄìCharlotte N\not\ne \nIntercity Passenger \nCorridor-type services             \nNortheast Corridor‚ÄìCharlotte 8  8  8  8  8  8  \nRaleigh‚ÄìCharlotte 0  0  0  10  10  10  \nOther Virginia services 12 B 0  0  0  0  0  \nTotal, Corridor-type services 20  8  8  18  18  18  \nLong-distance services             \nNortheast Corridor‚ÄìFlorida (Note J) 8  8  2  0 J 0  0  \nNortheast Corridor‚ÄìAtlanta (Note D) 0 D 0  0  0  4 C 4 C\nLorton, Virginia‚ÄìFlorida AutoTrain 2  0 M 0  0  0  0  \nTotal, Long-distance services 10  8  2  0  4  4  \nTotal Intercity Passenger 30  16 M 10  18  22  22  \nCommuter \nVirginia Railway Express 44 E 0  0  0  0  0  \nConcord ‚Äì Charlotte 0  0  0  0  0  22 F\nTotal, Commuter 44  0  0  0  0  22  \nFreight \nTotal freight services,  \nCSXT and NS (Note G) 32 \nH 10 \nM,\nN 14 I 8 K 34  32 L\nGrand Total, \nCharlotte-Richmond Corridor 106  26  24  26 \nJ,  \nK 56  76 \nC,\n F.\nNote A Projections for the Washington‚ÄìRichmond segment are provided for information only, as that segment is not part of the focus of this monograph.

Only eight NS freight trains are projected to operate between Fetner and Greensboro. \nNote L An additional ten Asheville Line trains per day enter or leave the corridor at Salisbury \nNote M Includes only those passenger and freight services operating between Main Street Station and Centralia on the S Line.  Because of the assumed change in \nrouting, these figures are not comparable with the analogous figures in Table 2-5. \nNote N These trains would operate only between the Main Street Station area and Centralia, en route between the CSXT Charlottesville‚ÄìGordonsville‚Äì Doswell‚Äì\nRichmond line and the A Line south of Centralia. \n \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n To satisfy this potential demand, most of which would relieve overburdened highways of \nintercity travelers, the 2020 service would include nine daily round trips,4 as follows: \n‚Ä¢ New York‚ÄìRichmond‚ÄìWashington‚ÄìCharlotte trains (four round trips); and \n‚Ä¢ Raleigh‚ÄìCharlotte trains (five round trips). \nIf a trip time of less than two hours is attained for the Richmond-Washington route, travel \ntime between New York and Charlotte would be about 9.5 hours, while travel times between \nWashington and Charlotte would be slightly more than 6.5 hours. \nSoutheast Corridor high-speed passenger train service5 may someday continue on from \nCharlotte to Atlanta and beyond, should the States ultimately elect to pursue such an extension.  \nThe planning for improved Charlotte‚ÄìAtlanta service remains in its formative stages6; therefore, \nno such service south of Charlotte was assumed or modeled in the present study.  Because of the \nmarket potential of the various city-pairs involved, the distances and travel times attached to \npotential train operations, and the need to cycle equipment and crews for optimal utilization, \nCharlotte would likely serve as the terminus for a considerable share of corridor trains‚éØin the \ndirections of both Raleigh/Richmond/Washington and Atlanta‚éØif the Atlanta extension comes \nto fruition.   \nLong-Distance Trains \nAt the time this analysis was completed,7 Amtrak envisioned four daily Florida overnight \ntrains in each direction by 2020, an increase of one over current schedules. For this study it was \nenvisioned that three of the trains (the Silver Meteor, the Silver Palm, and the one new train) \nwould operate between Richmond‚Äôs Main Street Station and Centralia on the upgraded S Line, \nthen use the CSXT A Line southward to Florida. The fourth train (the Silver Star) would operate \nvia the S Line and Raleigh. However, the simulated schedules are subject to further refinement \nas work on the Southeast Corridor progresses, and as national policies toward intercity passenger \nrail service evolve; thus, train routings and timetables could ultimately vary from those assumed. \nThe proposed alignment between Richmond and Raleigh, consisting of segments of single-track \nwith relatively evenly spaced sidings, has been formulated to easily accommodate these potential \nmodifications.  \nAs this analysis was underway, Amtrak was also considering the addition of a second \ndaily long distance train between Washington and Atlanta, in addition to the current \nWashington‚ÄìNew Orleans Crescent trains.  This study assumed that any such additional \n                                                 \n4 Note that the operations are expressed in Table 3-1 as ‚Äútrain movements,‚Äù i.e., a daily round trip counts as two \nmovements.  This method of expression reflects the inherent directional imbalance in freight traffic, which cannot be \naccurately projected in terms of ‚Äúround trips.‚Äù  \n5 As distinguished from conventional Amtrak long-distance trains, which already link Charlotte with points south \nand west, and are discussed below. \n6 Such a possible extension is part of the SEC designation, but is just now entering the feasibility study stage.

Some of these plans are incorporated in \nthe operational simulations underlying this monograph. \nRaleigh \nAs a result of several years of planning, the Triangle Transit Authority (TTA) and the \nTriangle Region's two Metropolitan Planning Organizations have adopted the Regional Transit \nPlan, which includes Regional Rail service and expanded bus service, shuttles, park and ride \nfacilities, and enhanced pedestrian and bicycle access to transit. The plan9 is divided into several \nphases. The Regional Rail system, proposed to be operational by 2007, would use self-propelled, \nbi-directional, diesel rail cars using new, dedicated trackage within the existing railroad rights-\nof-way to connect Durham, Research Triangle Park, Morrisville, Cary, Raleigh and North \nRaleigh. This service is expected to carry about 44,000 daily riders by 2025. Connections to the \nRDU Airport and Chapel Hill are considered Phase II of the Plan. Because there are no existing \nrail corridors that directly link these areas to the Phase I line, the planning, design, and ultimate \nconstruction are more complex. \nSince the Regional Rail system is presently envisioned by the local authorities as using \nits own tracks, and thus not normally interacting with the intercity passenger and freight railroad \ntraffic, its operations are not included in the train schedules, operating simulations, or traffic \nsummaries prepared for this monograph.  Proper planning is required to assure the optimal \ncoexistence of the proposed transit and high-speed rail systems.  If the commuter rail plans for \nthe Raleigh region should ever change so as to include shared usage of the same tracks by \ncommuter, freight, and intercity passenger trains, then the schedules and facility configurations \ndeveloped in this study for the Raleigh vicinity would require substantial modification. \n                                                 \n8 With the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte improvements in place, there would be no physical impediment to operating a \nsecond Washington‚ÄìAtlanta round trip via Richmond and Raleigh instead of Charlottesville and Lynchburg, should \nthe intercity passenger operator elect to do so.  Also, the Silver Star between Richmond and Raleigh on the S Line \nwould enjoy improved reliability within that segment, and‚éØpotentially‚éØa better overall timetable subject to the \ncapabilities of its equipment consist and the ability of the intercity passenger rail operator and the CSXT to \nimplement schedule improvements over the route as a whole. \n9 The description of the Raleigh transit plan in this monograph is provided for information only.  Obviously, the \nRegional Rail proposal is subject to all requisite environmental and other public processes, including, for example, \napplicable reviews and approvals by FRA‚Äôs Office of Safety. \n 3-4\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n Charlotte \nThe City of Charlotte projects that increasing commuter travel demand by 2020 will \nnecessitate the initiation of commuter rail service between Concord and Charlotte on the \nPiedmont Main Line (approximately 25 miles).  Additional new commuter services are also \npossible by 2020.10  A study of the potential for commuter rail operations in the Charlotte-\nConcord corridor is underway.  For analytical purposes, this monograph has assumed that by \n2020 half-hourly peak service in morning southward between Concord and Charlotte (8 trains) \nand in the afternoon northward between Charlotte and Concord (8 trains) will be operated.  \nThree morning and three evening reverse-direction nonrevenue trains also were assumed, to \nlessen equipment needs.  This schedule, then, would include 22 daily commuter train \nmovements. \nAlthough the possibility of turning trains at the Charlotte Airport instead of in downtown \nCharlotte was recognized, it was not implemented in the working timetables in Appendix F.  \nLayover facilities in Charlotte for day storage of commuter trains were not identified in this \nstudy; overnight storage facilities in the vicinity of Adams Interlocking, just north of Concord, \nwere assumed but not incorporated in the design.  All these matters will require careful analysis \nand resolution prior to the implementation of commuter service in this sector. \nFreight \nCharacteristics of Freight Service \nFreight operations are much more variable than passenger services, in terms of arrival \nand departure times, train size, train performance, and frequency in a given period of time. \nFreight trains vary significantly in their performance capabilities and their compatibility with \npassenger trains: for example, unit trains of coal and grain generally have a lower horsepower-\nto-tonnage ratio than more time-sensitive operations.  Thus, a general merchandise or intermodal \ntrain ordinarily takes less time to clear a given route segment than a unit coal train. Most freight \ntrains operated on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte route are general merchandise and intermodal trains. \nBecause almost all intercity passenger trains on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor \noperate during daylight hours, the line would, in theory, offer more flexibility to freight \noperations late at night. In practice, however, the for-profit freight carriers have far-flung \noperations of which the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor constitutes but one segment.  Customer \ndemands, scheduling requirements, and operating constraints elsewhere on their extremely large \nand complex networks have led the freight railroads to operate their trains in the Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte traffic lanes throughout the day.  Therefore, the need to provide service reliability \nfor intercity passenger and freight trains alike, throughout the day, has governed the \ndesign and evaluation of the improvements contemplated in this monograph. \n                                                 \n10 For example, as described in Chapter 6, the concept for the Charlotte Station allows for possible future commuter \nservice between Charlotte and Monroe on the CSXT, and between Charlotte and the NS‚Äôs Statesville line. \n 3-5\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n As explained below, the need to efficiently manage peak traffic would become even more \ncritical in the future: not only would rail passenger ridership grow, but CSXT and NS levels of \nfreight traffic also are projected to increase.  In fact, the I-95 and I-81 freight corridors, which \nparallel the Northeast Corridor and Southeast Corridor, have been identified as key growth lanes \nfor the two freight companies.  \nProjected Service Levels \nThis study used existing levels of freight service, augmented by changes projected by \nCSXT and forecast by FRA for NS.  The Operating Plan contained in the joint application to the \nSTB, in June 1997, for the Conrail Acquisition served as an additional source of information to \nvalidate the freight service assumptions.  In addition, CSX provided information on planned \noperations between Raleigh and Richmond as the result of the restoration of the S Line.   \nOn the segment with the highest level of train movements, the P Line between \nGreensboro and Charlotte, approximately 33 daily freight train movements (total of both \ndirections) were simulated‚éØa one-third increase over today‚Äôs levels, as depicted in Table 2-4.  \nIncreases in intermodal trains, which have higher horsepower-per-ton locomotive assignments \nand achieve higher operating speeds than other freight operations, are expected to account for \nmuch of the expansion in freight traffic.  \n \n 3-6\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \nTables in Chapter 3 \nTable 3-1: Railroad Services Envisioned for 2020 in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor ................. 2-2 \n \n \n  \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n  \n \nChapter 4:  \nMETHODOLOGY  \nAND ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS \nThis chapter presents the overall methodology of the study and describes in detail \nthe underlying operations analysis.  Unlike previous transportation plans in this series,1 \nthe present study envisions high-speed rail primarily on a single-track railroad, of which \nthe operating characteristics will differ markedly from those of multiple-track routes.  \nSince transportation planners in other regions of the United States may wish to consider \nanalogous single-track alternatives for high-speed rail, this discussion could be of value \nwell beyond the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor.  \nMethodology \nSources for this study included reports prepared by and for NCDOT and VDRPT, \ntrack diagrams, maps, equipment specifications, filings before the Surface Transportation \nBoard (STB), and other engineering and ownership documentation.  Limited field \ninvestigations took place to verify existing conditions.  Also, the study team consulted \nwith appropriate State, local, Amtrak, and freight railroad officials to assess the status of \ntheir respective plans, and to assemble a consensus list of possible projects that would \nassist all operators to meet their service goals. Extensive inputs, review, and comments \nwere solicited from these agencies and railroads, and numerous meetings took place to \ndiscuss the effort and resolve differences.  The work process is described in this chapter. \nWork Performed by the States and Amtrak \nPrior to the present study, the Rail Division of the NCDOT received funding from \nthe FRA under Section 1036 of ISTEA to conduct master planning for high-speed rail \npassenger service from Raleigh to Charlotte and Raleigh to Richmond. NCDOT \nsubsequently contracted with Amtrak to coordinate and complete an assessment of the \ncorridor.  That study includes an assessment of the existing conditions, capacities, and \nimprovements needed.  Technical Reports and a Final Report2 were prepared and were \nextensively used in the performance of the analyses documented in this monograph. \nVDRPT recently completed a study of signal and train control improvements for \nthis corridor.  The study identified short-term upgrades for the existing signal system and \nlong-term recommendations as to the type of signal system that should ultimately be in \nplace when plans for fast, frequent passenger rail service are fully implemented. \n                                                 \n1 The transportation plans prepared for the Northeast, Keystone (Philadelphia‚ÄìHarrisburg), and \nWashington‚ÄìRichmond corridors all involve lines with two or more tracks. \n2 TranSystems Corporation for NCDOT and Amtrak. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nAmtrak, on a continuing basis, has reviewed service options for the SEC as an \nextension of its service between New York and Washington. Amtrak personnel have \nactively participated in the studies performed by each of the States and have provided \ninput and comments to this study. \nFinally, NCDOT has prepared a Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for \nthe Southeast Corridor, which encompasses the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte segment described \nin this document.3\nData Collection And Organization \nDevelopment of this Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte study included a limited review of the \ncurrent4 condition of the Corridor and its ability to safely and efficiently handle the \nexisting levels of rail services operated by Amtrak, CSXT, and NS.  The review included, \nbut was not limited to, track conditions and configurations, roadbed and under-grade \nbridge conditions, signal and traffic control systems, passenger stations, and maintenance \nfacilities. \nConsultations took place with staff members of Amtrak, CSXT, NCRR, the City \nof Charlotte, NCDOT, and VDRPT who were involved with rail operations in the \nCorridor.5  The objective was to obtain data on existing and projected 2020 train \noperations, to obtain information on presently planned improvements to the Corridor, and \nto review preliminary findings with railroad owners, operators, and public officials so as \nto resolve their concerns and needs prior to the preparation of this monograph. \nFixed plant location, design, and condition information came from recent railroad-\nsupplied track charts, curve data, and track maintenance program descriptions; from maps \nand other available documents; from limited on-site-inspections; and from outputs of the \nFRA track geometry car.6  From those sources a brief description of the condition of the \nexisting Raleigh‚ÄìCharlotte rail plant was developed  (Chapter 2).   Summaries of current \nand projected 2020 service levels for commuter, intercity passenger, and freight \noperations appear in Chapters 2 and 3. \nA summary of track and station ownership, leases, operating and occupancy rights \nto the land, equipment, and fixtures was prepared.7  It included an outline of the various \noperating agreements that pertain to both freight and passenger rail service between \nCharlotte and Richmond (Appendix E).  This information resulted from contacts with \nentities having possible ownership or operating interest in Corridor right-of-way, stations, \nand air rights.  Pertinent maps, drawings, agreements (e.g., trackage rights, maintenance, \n                                                 \n3 For the current status of the EIS, see the section in Chapter 1 entitled ‚ÄúImportant Note on the \nEnvironmental Process.‚Äù \n4 As of 1999. \n5 The NS did not participate in the study, as mentioned in Chapter 1, and other sources were tapped to \ndescribe and project NS‚Äôs operations. \n6 This car operates over portions of the Corridor in support of Amtrak intercity operations. \n7 North Carolina and Virginia are separately evaluating ownership of the abandoned portion of the ‚ÄúS‚Äù Line \nbetween Norlina, NC and Centralia, VA. \n 4-2\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nand operating), franchises, government permits, title documents, and other data relating \nto ownership and use of the right-of-way (inclusive of all fixed and moveable-span \nbridges), and stations were reviewed. \nInitial Development Of Improvements \nDraft documentation detailing a program of improvements in the Charlotte‚Äì \nRichmond Corridor was prepared and submitted to participating entities for review and \ncomment.  The proposed improvements aimed at upgrading the railroad facilities to \nhandle the projected levels of intercity, commuter, and freight service safely and \nefficiently in 2020. \nThe study team compiled a list of potential Corridor improvement projects on the \nbasis of prior reports, documents, and improvement programs; consultation with the \nowners and operators of the railroads, and with Federal, state, and local government \nagencies; and field investigations to verify existing conditions.  Projected operating \nschedules for Corridor users over the next 20 years also were obtained and reviewed, so \nthat a determination could be made whether the planned improvements would suffice to \nhandle the projected traffic levels. \nSpecific projects that needed further analysis or conceptual development were \nidentified, and additional information was gathered to enable recommendations to be \ndeveloped.  Projects that were reviewed primarily included proposals to: \n‚Ä¢ Upgrade and restore the track structure; \n‚Ä¢ Install new signaling and traffic control systems; \n‚Ä¢ Realign selected curves to increase operating speeds and reduce trip \ntime8; \n‚Ä¢ Reconfigure, eliminate, or install interlockings to improve operating \nflexibility; \n‚Ä¢ Install trackage to accommodate increased traffic levels; and \n‚Ä¢ Initiate station improvements. \nReports, plans, drawings, schematics, schedules, results of operational analyses, \nand budgets were reviewed to identify areas requiring follow-on investigations.  \nPhotographs and video also were used in the analytical process.  \nAs each project that might affect rail operations was identified, a project data \nsheet was initiated.  The data sheet information included, wherever possible: a \ndescription, location on the Corridor, and the rationale for the improvement. \n                                                 \n8Studies recently performed for NCDOT proposed maximum speeds for individual curves, as follows:  \n‚Äï Between Main Street Station, Richmond, and Centralia: 79 mph; and \n‚Äï Between Centralia and Charlotte: 110 mph. \nThese speeds were used as initial speed goals, but were modified as necessary to reflect the iterative \nanalysis process subsequently defined.  The curve analysis was based on data taken from a variety of track \nchart sources between Main Street Station and Raleigh and data obtained from a recent FRA track \ngeometry car run between Raleigh and Charlotte. \n 4-3\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nAfter the proposed projects were identified, evaluated and documented, before-\nand-after diagrams (track charts) were developed.  These are included in Appendix D. \nThe preparation of the preliminary list of projects to meet program goals was a \nlimited iterative process.  The process resulted in a list of projects that would‚Äî \n‚Ä¢ meet intercity passenger rail service goals based on reduced running \ntimes and higher frequency of service;  \n‚Ä¢ enable other services to coexist at their proposed levels without \ndegradation; and  \n‚Ä¢ accommodate projected or future growth or changing conditions, such \nas increased commuter and freight operations in the Corridor. \nScenarios to achieve the best integration of intercity, commuter, and freight rail \nservices were prepared, based on operational constraints identified from analyses of the \nprojected 2020 intercity, commuter, and freight volumes. \nAs necessary, alternative projects, beyond those initially proposed, that would \nenable attainment of the stated goals were developed, analyzed, and included. \nProject Categories \nEach proposed improvement was assigned to one of three major categories \ndefining the basic purpose of the work:  trip time-related projects, capacity-related \nprojects, and ‚Äúprerequisite and other‚Äù projects.  While this categorization is useful \nanalytically, the categories can overlap: some trip time-related projects would help to \nimprove capacity, and some capacity-related projects would help to reduce trip times. \nTrip Time-Related Projects \nProjects generally contributing directly to lower trip times or permitting higher \noperating speeds, were included in this category: \n‚Ä¢ Curve realignments and construction of new line segments replacing \nexisting track; \n‚Ä¢ Curve and spiral9 modifications; \n‚Ä¢ Interlocking reconfigurations; \n‚Ä¢ Signal modifications for higher speeds; and \n‚Ä¢ Use of high performance trains. \nCapacity-Related Projects \nProjects providing additional railroad capacity to preserve attainment of the trip \ntime goals while accommodating higher train frequencies were included in this category: \n‚Ä¢ Installation of additional tracks; \n‚Ä¢ Installation of higher-speed turnouts and crossovers; \n                                                 \n9 A spiral is a transition with gradually increasing curvature and superelevation between straight and curved \ntrack, designed to ease the dynamic forces of track/train interaction and to assure acceptable ride quality. \n 4-4\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Adding or reconfiguring interlockings; and \n‚Ä¢ Installation of additional signal speed commands.  \nPrerequisite and Other Projects \nThis category‚éØconsisting of projects without which a safe, reliable, accessible, \nand marketable passenger service could not function‚éØwould include such items as \nhighway/railroad grade crossing improvements, right-of-way fencing, equipment support \nfacilities, and stations.  Many of these projects‚Äô benefits would extend to commuter and \nfreight operations as well. \nPreliminary Project Phasing \nA detailed project schedule for constructing these projects was not developed.  \nInstead, a preliminary phasing analysis was performed to identify project priorities and \nthe relative interface of projects.  The phasing of projects was determined once an agreed \npriority for projects and individual construction work items was established.  This \napproach included an analysis of constraints associated with projects that would depend \non track availability for construction.  Phasing generally took into consideration logistics \nand procurement of materials and equipment, availability of resources, environmental \napprovals, real estate acquisitions, track availability, and funding availability. \nAssessment of Projects \nThe trip-time and capacity benefits associated with individual projects were \nidentified based on the operational analyses.  Detailed environmental analysis was not \nperformed; however, experience gained from studies of this nature was reviewed to \nensure that recommended projects could reasonably be assumed to be implemented with \na minimum of environmental disruption.  These tentative findings are without prejudice \nto ongoing and subsequent environmental processes pertaining to the proposed operation.   \nWork to identify the potential changes in intercity ridership, revenues, and costs \nas the result of implementing the contemplated projects, and the proposed 2020 intercity \nrail service schedules, was not performed; much of the economic analysis has already \ntaken place under the purview of the States and as part of the FRA‚Äôs Commercial \nFeasibility Study of High-Speed Ground Transportation.10\nEquipment Assumption \nBoth tilting and non-tilting equipment types were evaluated in the TPC model.  \nThe results indicated that the use of tilting equipment would optimize trip time while \nminimizing the number of curve relocations necessary to achieve trip time goals; the \ncurve realignments were designed so as to enable the achievement of the trip-time goals \nwith tilting equipment. Likewise, some of the simulations assumed the use of tilting \nequipment.   \n                                                 \n10 See FRA 1997, chapter 8. \n 4-5\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nCost Estimates \nThe final steps in the planning process included the development of conceptual \ncost estimates and the categorization of the projects according to purpose and need. \nConceptual, order-of-magnitude estimates for each project identified and \naddressed in this study were developed in 2000 dollars.11  Appropriate levels of \ncontingency, reflecting the level of project development, were included.  \nCertain categories of investment were neither addressed in detail nor included in \nthe cost estimates, but will inevitably form part of the total implementation package.  \nThey will thus require careful attention by the States, localities, the intercity rail \npassenger operator, and other project partners.  These categories include but are not \nlimited to: \n‚Ä¢ High-speed rail equipment acquisition (locomotives and cars, likely \npurchased together as ‚Äútrainsets‚Äù); \n‚Ä¢ Real estate, including right-of-way, acquisition where necessary (e.g., the \nS Line); and \n‚Ä¢ Station buildings,12 parking, and access improvements. \nAnalysis Of Operations \nThis section summarizes the analysis and provides essential details. \nOverview of the Analysis \nThe analysis compared the services as presently envisioned by the operators for \n2020, with the fixed plant as configured today and as upgraded with various carefully \nordered combinations of improvements.  The analysis focused on two questions: \n‚Ä¢ Can individual trains meet their trip-time goals, irrespective of other \ntraffic? and \n‚Ä¢ Can all the services operate in combination at intended speeds and \nschedules over the Corridor, while still meeting their reliability \nimperatives? \nTo answer the first question, the study team used a computer model known as a \ntrain performance calculator (TPC) to model the operation of a single train, with defined \nperformance characteristics, over a traffic-free railroad with profile, alignment, and \nmaximum speeds as specified for each segment.  The TPC was applied to prototypical \nfreight, intercity passenger, and commuter trains, to assess their optimal performance \nover the Corridor under different sets of conditions. The TPC runs were used to assess the \n                                                 \n11 These are presented in Table 7-1. \n12 Except in limited instances described in Chapters 5 and 7. \n 4-6\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\neffectiveness of the proposed projects‚éØtaken together13‚éØin enabling the various types \nof service to achieve their trip time goals. \nHowever, the mere physical possibility of operating a given train over a given \nright-of-way at a given trip time offers no assurance that a combination of services can \nreliably operate on the Corridor. \nThus, to answer the second question above, the study team evaluated the capacity \nof the recommended system by performing a detailed manual and computerized \noperations simulations analysis, which assessed the reliability of the projected intercity, \ncommuter, and freight services operating on the trackage between Richmond and \nCharlotte. The modeling technique utilized was the same sophisticated Monte Carlo‚Ñ¢ \nmodel used on previous studies of the Northeast Corridor and the Washington‚ÄìRichmond \nsegment of the Southeast Corridor.14 The model incorporated random variations in \noperating conditions and train performance to simulate the full spectrum of freight, \nintercity passenger, and commuter services projected for 2020 in the Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte Corridor.  These simulations assessed the impacts of changes in both schedules \nand fixed plant capabilities on all services operating simultaneously over a hypothetical \nseven-day test period.  The operations simulation methodology and results are discussed \nin Appendix C. \nThe TPC‚Äôs ‚Äúminimum running time‚Äù represents the optimal physical performance \nof the equipment and its operator, with the train running unencumbered by other trains \nover a route.  These conditions will not occur in day-to-day operation; therefore in \ncreating schedules, upward adjustments must be made to the minimum TPC running time \nto reflect the factors that will inevitably reduce performance. In this context, ‚Äúdelay‚Äù may \nbe defined as the difference between the minimum running time‚éØas calculated by the \nTPC‚éØand the ‚Äúactual‚Äù running time‚éØin this case, as simulated.  The difference between \nthe minimum running time and the scheduled trip time is known as ‚Äúpad.‚Äù  \n ‚ÄúPad‚Äù is added to a TPC minimum running time to produce a schedule that can \nbe operated reliably, repetitively, and with a high degree of confidence.  The reliable \nschedule, containing schedule recovery time, will satisfy the expectations of: \n‚Ä¢ The passengers, who need to know when they will arrive at a given station, \nand \n‚Ä¢ The train operator, who needs to plan equipment cycles and service frequency. \nThus, in a given operation, if the delay incurred is less than or equal to the pad \nprovided in the schedule, the train is on time; if the delay exceeds the pad, the train is \nlate.15\n                                                 \n13 Each project was not separately evaluated. \n14 See Chapter 1 for more information on the Washington‚ÄìRichmond study. \n15 Throughout this monograph, the terms ‚Äúon time‚Äù and ‚Äúlate‚Äù are used in their exact sense, without \nallowances or thresholds of any kind; i.e., ‚Äúon time‚Äù means on or before the ‚Äúpublished‚Äù arrival time. \n 4-7\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nSince the assumed Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor would be a new route for fast \npassenger trains, there is no historical performance data for rail service planners to draw \nupon for the contemplated high-speed service. Therefore, schedule design standards and \nthe results of train operations simulations performed for the study were used to estimate \nhow much ‚Äúpad,‚Äù recovery time, must be added to the minimum, optimal TPC running \ntimes to produce a reliable train schedule. \nTaken together, the TPC runs and the detailed operating simulations permitted the \nstudy team to compare intended schedules, optimal running times, and expected \nperformance for all services.  The effects of alternative schedules and fixed plant \ncapabilities were evaluated through numerous model runs.  By these means the study \nteam developed a preliminary list of potential projects and priorities that would meet the \ntrip time and reliability goals of the study.  Synthesizing the results of investigations to \ndate, this monograph provides a resource on which the States can draw in their further \nplanning, design, and partnership/financial development of the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte \nCorridor, in cooperation with all interested parties including the freight railroads. \nAnalysis of Train Interactions \nBackground: Signaling and Train Control \nThe Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor makes use of a wide variety of signaling and \ntrain control systems.  These systems are important because they largely determine the \noperational capabilities of the various line segments and constitute an important part of \nthe contemplated improvement program.  The following sections provide general \nbackground on the important topic of signaling and train control. \nNon-Signaled Operation \nIn the early days of railroad operation in North America, trains were operated \nstrictly by printed schedules in a ‚Äútimetable‚Äù that established meeting points for opposing \ntrains, or passing points for trains operating in the same direction. The operation was \ninflexible, and was supplemented by a system that utilized the telegraph, and later the \ntelephone, to provide train crews with written instructions, known as train orders, \ninstructing them to proceed or wait. The train orders enabled trains without timetable \nschedules to operate and train dispatchers to change meeting or passing points if trains \nwere late, or delayed. In the late 20th Century train orders were replaced by a Track \nWarrant Control system, which utilized direct radio communications (‚ÄúDirect Train \nControl‚Äù) between dispatcher and train crew to provide authorization for a train to occupy \na specified track segment to the next expected meeting point. Direct Train Control \neliminated intermediate local ‚Äúoperators‚Äù at interlockings, thus reducing costs. \nFor a meet to occur, the crew of the train designated to take the siding stops, and \nmanually aligns the switch for the siding. The train then proceeds to clear the main line \nand the crew manually closes the switch. The train remains in the siding until the \n 4-8\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nopposing train passes16 and the crew is authorized to re-enter the main track and proceed \nto the next planned meeting point. The Track Warrant Control system simplified and \nimproved the efficiency of train dispatching, but did not increase the capacity of the \nsingle-track system.  The H Line, between Fetner and Greensboro, was operated utilizing \nTrack Warrants while this monograph was in preparation. \nBlock Signaling \nLate in the 19th Century, a system of train control based on breaking the railroad \ninto a series of ‚Äúblocks‚Äù and ‚Äúinterlockings‚Äù was implemented.  The train control system \nconsisted of two types of signals, both of which were controlled manually by a block \noperator working under the instructions of the train dispatcher: \n‚Ä¢ Manual block signals, which indicated the presence of trains to other trains \nand thereby served to space trains; and \n‚Ä¢ Interlocking signals, which controlled the movement of trains through \ncomplex trackwork (turnouts, passing sidings, crossings, crossovers, \njunctions, or drawbridges). \nThe signals allowed only one train in a block at a time, to prevent rear-end (by a \nfollowing train), side-on (by a merging train), and head-on (by a train in the opposite \ndirection) collisions, and minimize the potential for human failures. The manual block \nsignal systems increased the efficiency, speed, and capacity of a line to handle trains \nsafely. \nOver time, ‚Äúmanual block signals‚Äù in which a human operator sets signals were \nreplaced by ‚Äúautomatic block signals‚Äù (ABS), which employ a series of consecutive \nblocks of track with signals actuated by the movement of the trains themselves. The \npresence of a train (which is detected by a ‚Äúfail safe‚Äù electric track circuit in the rails) sets \nsignals to instruct a following train not to enter the same block and creates a safe spacing \nof trains by slowing down closely following trains.  Automatic block signals maintain a \nsafe separation of trains running in the same direction and also keep trains running in \nopposite directions from entering the same block of track.  They do this ‚Äúautomatically,‚Äù \nbased on the simple logic of the track circuits, without dispatcher or block operator \nintervention. Capacity is increased when signals are spaced so that a following train, or a \ntrain to be met at a siding, does not have to slow down to maintain a safe separation \nbetween trains or avoid a conflict with an opposing train. \nInterlockings \nInterlockings are locations where tracks branch away, cross over each other, or \npermit trains to change tracks. They are controlled by a local operator or by the train \ndispatcher and are programmed to ‚Äúlock out‚Äù the occurrence of conflicting routes within \nthe interlocking. Access to or from a siding in single-track ABS territory is controlled by \ninterlockings at each end, that enable a train to diverge to an available side track, while \n                                                 \n16  Or the opposing trains pass; there can be more than one. \n 4-9\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nensuring that a following or opposing train has a clear route to proceed. All signals at \ninterlockings are set to \"Stop\" unless they are cleared for a specific movement. \nCentralized Traffic Control \nControl of an interlocking, or series of interlockings, is ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù when the \ninterlockings at a series of locations are controlled from a machine in the dispatcher‚Äôs \noffice, rather than by a block operator at each interlocking. The Centralized Traffic \nControl (CTC) system improves the efficiency of train operations on heavily traveled \nroutes by eliminating the dispatcher‚Äôs need to communicate with local operators to \ncontrol train movements. CTC ensures the safety of operation and provides a level of \nflexibility that maximizes the capacity of a track network. Direct control over all the \ninterlockings on a CTC line allows the dispatcher to control the movement of trains by \nchanging their track assignments, using sidings, and applying priorities to trains‚Äô \nmovements to minimize delays.  Experience has shown that a single-track main line, with \nfrequent sidings controlled by CTC, has about 70 percent of the traffic-handling capacity \nof a double-track line with ABS signals under normal operating conditions. However, the \ncapacity of a single-track rail line can decline dramatically when a train failure occurs or \nthe track must be shut down to enable track maintenance to be performed.  \nIn the early 1940s, the then-heavily-trafficked S Line between Richmond and \nRaleigh was one of the first rail lines to have a CTC system installed. CTC enabled the \ndispatcher to plan moves based on lights on a large board indicating the location of all \ntrains. The CTC and ABS systems were removed prior to the abandonment of the line \nbetween Centralia and Norlina. Train movements between Norlina and Raleigh reverted \nto being controlled by Direct Train Control. \nAutomatic Train Control and Continuous Cab Signals \nWhile CTC remotely controls the signals and turnout settings, it relies on train \noperator alertness and compliance to ensure that the train‚Äôs movement is in accordance \nwith the signals.  More sophisticated systems‚éØcurrently in place on only a few lines in \nthe country, such as the Northeast Corridor‚éØare necessary to provide for improved \ncontrol over train movements, to still further reduce the possibility of collisions.  Such \nsystems, mandatory for any operations over 79 mph, 17 provide for automatic \nenforcement of signal aspects if the operator should fail to do so for any reason.  \nAccordingly, as described in Chapter 5, this study included continuous cab signaling18 \n                                                 \n17 49 CFR Part 236 states ‚ÄúWhere any train is operated at a speed of 80 or more miles per hour, an \nautomatic cab signal, automatic train stop or automatic train control system complying with the provisions \nof [the Railroad Safety Regulations] shall be installed.‚Äù \n18 Cab signaling is ‚Äúcontinuous‚Äù if it constantly displays the ruling signals in real time.  (An older type of \nsystem, ‚Äúintermittent‚Äù cab signals, only displays the ruling signals at specific locations‚éØe.g., near the \nwayside signals‚éØand, while representing a safety enhancement over wayside signals alone, offers only \nlimited operational advantages.) \n 4-10\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nand automatic train control19 in the contemplated program for the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte \nCorridor. \nOperations in Single-Track Territory (Richmond‚ÄìGreensboro) \nAmong high-speed corridors for which transportation plans of this type have been \nprepared, the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte railway is unique‚éØnot only in its innovative assumed \nrouting, but in its use of some single-track segments that have never been upgraded for \nfast passenger service, and that are, in part, abandoned.  This corridor, however, may \nestablish a precedent for similar situations elsewhere in the Nation, where an existing \nfreight and passenger corridor is either too indirect‚éØor too burdened with traffic‚éØto \nprovide an economic solution for high-speed rail, while a parallel route‚éØpossibly \nabandoned or downgraded‚éØmay offer plenty of capacity.  Therefore, the operating \nimplications of the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor‚Äôs special configuration merit \nexploration at some length in this monograph.   \nSingle-Track Operations \nThe S Line between Petersburg, Virginia and Raleigh, North Carolina, and the H \nLine between Fetner and Greensboro, North Carolina, were constructed as single-track \nrail lines. Relatively evenly spaced, short sidings were provided to enable trains to meet \nor overtake other trains. The primary challenge of dispatching trains on a single-track line \nis to set up, at the appropriate sidings, ‚Äúmeets,‚Äù in which trains moving in opposite \ndirections can pass each other with minimal delay, and ‚Äúovertakes,‚Äù in which a train can \nbe passed by a faster train moving in the same direction.  \nFacility Planning and Operational Analyses Considerations \nSeveral critical issue regarding siding spacing and length, track capacity, and train \ndispatching require attention during the planning process, to assure sufficient operating \nflexibility and capacity to support reliable, efficient, and timely mixed freight and \npassenger operations. Issues related to single- and multi-track operations are discussed in \nthis section. The constraints presented by operations in the vicinity of major yards and \nterminal facilities are discussed elsewhere in this document.   \n  \nLength and Spacing of Sidings \nThe spacing of the sidings on a single-track system determines the capacity of the \nsystem and also the length of the delays when meets do occur.  \nFacility and operational analyses of the proposed Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte high-speed \npassenger operations concluded that sidings necessary to support reliable freight and \npassenger operations should be 3.5 to 4 miles long and spaced approximately every 15 \nmiles, center-to-center, i.e., the length of single-track between sidings should not exceed \n                                                 \n19 A system that automatically stops a train if a restrictive signal indication is ignored. It is not a system of \nautomated train operation. \n 4-11\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n11 miles. Number 20 (45-mph) turnouts should be installed at the ends of each siding.20 \nThe size and spacing of the sidings would minimize delay to the train entering the \nsiding21 and increase the probability of meets that would allow it to continue out the other \nend, without stopping. \nTypes of Contemplated Meets and Overtakes \nThe simulations encompassed all types of interactions among intercity passenger, \nfreight, and commuter trains.  It was assumed that intercity passenger trains would have \noperational priority over all other service types, and that commuter trains would have \nprecedence over freight trains; physical improvements were provided to assure that \ncommuter and freight services would retain acceptable levels of reliability.  Given the \nimportance and high priority of the intercity passenger operations over the entire length \nof the corridor, interactions among such trains are a critical operational and design \nconcern. \nMeets Between Intercity Passenger Trains \nThe single-track S Line would be restored, and the mostly-single-track H Line \nwould be upgraded, to facilitate high-speed passenger service.   Thus, minimizing delays \nis a necessary and prominent consideration in planning the project. Simulations \nperformed for this study, and modeling a full week‚Äôs operations, indicated that each \npassenger train on the 157-mile segment between Richmond and Raleigh and on the \nbusier 73-mile segment between Fetner and Greensboro22 will participate in an average of \n1.2 meets per segment per day.23 Each time such a meet occurs, one passenger train \nwould be required to slow down, enter a siding, and wait for the opposing passenger train \nto go past at full speed on the main track.  The full-week simulation further indicated that, \nas a result of participation in these meets within the combined Richmond‚ÄìRaleigh and \nFetner‚ÄìGreensboro single-track territories, a typical passenger train between Richmond \n                                                 \n20 The installation of Number 32, 80-mph turnouts to increase capacity and minimize delays at a few \nlocations is discussed on page 4-14. The higher the switch number, the smaller the diverging angle of the \nswitch, and the faster a train may operate safely over the diverging route. Speed limits for diverging moves \nthrough various types of turnouts are shown in the following table: \nMaximum Speed for \nDiverging Moves \nTurnout/ Crossover \nDesignation \n Maximum Speed for \nDiverging Moves \nTurnout/ Crossover \nDesignation \n15 mph No. 10  45 mph (passenger)/\n40 mph (freight) \nNo. 20 \n30 mph No. 15  80 mph No. 32 \nNormally, speed limits for straight moves through crossovers and turnouts are the same as those for the \nadjoining track. \n21 See at page 4-14 for an explanation of the effects of siding length on main line fluidity. \n22 9 pairs of high-speed trains would operate between Fetner and Greensboro, versus 4 pairs on the S Line \nnorth of Raleigh. \n23 I.e., a given train will be involved in 1.2 meets between Richmond and Raleigh, and 1.2 meets between \nRaleigh and Greensboro. \n 4-12\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nand Greensboro would incur an average of 9.5 minutes of total delay time in either \ndirection. \nTo ensure the reliability of the passenger train operations, a maximum delay of \nten minutes24 to the diverting train in a meet between two passenger trains was posited as \nthe worst-case scenario that would be tolerated.  Accordingly, the design criterion for \nsiding spacing was expressed in time rather than miles.25  The spacing of sidings in terms \nof time serves to minimize delays, thereby optimizing utilization of the passenger train \nfleet, achieving a balance in facility and fleet investment requirements, and enhancing the \nmarketability of the service. \nAlthough the maximum speed on the S Line is proposed to be 110 mph, the \nnumerous sharp curves and steep grades will reduce the average speed between station \nstops to approximately 90 mph. At 90 mph a train travels a mile in about two-thirds of a \nminute and will therefore‚éØwithin the posited limit of ten minutes‚éØtravel 15 miles. \nTherefore, the maximum acceptable center-to-center siding spacing on the S Line is 15 \nmiles.  If the sidings are four miles long, the length of single track between siding \nswitches should not exceed 11 miles. \nMinimizing Delay Within the Four-Mile Siding \nPlacing an intermediate signal at the mid-point of the four-mile siding would \nenhance train operations into and through the siding. The signal displayed at the entrance \nto the siding would allow the train entering the siding to proceed at the maximum speed \nthe interlocking turnout permitted. By arranging the signals in this way a long freight \ntrain would enter the siding at a maximum of 40 mph, and thereby clear the single track \nin the least possible time. The signal displayed at the middle of the siding would depend \nupon the status of the signal at the end of the siding. \nThe signal at the end of the siding would either: \n¬É Display ‚Äústop‚Äù and the intermediate signal would require the train in the \nsiding to begin braking and be prepared to stop at the signal at the leaving end \nof the siding26 if the train in the opposing direction, the one being met, had not \npassed the turnout at the end of the siding and cleared the interlocking, or \n¬É If the train being met had passed by and cleared the turnout at the end of the \nsiding, a signal would be displayed permitting the train in the siding to \n                                                 \n24 This ten-minute duration is not comparable to the 9.5 minutes mentioned in the previous paragraph: \nThe ten minutes is the maximum allowable delay (for siding spacing purposes) to the diverting train for any \none meet, while the 9.5 minutes is the average total simulated delay due to meets for a typical passenger \ntrain running from Raleigh to Greensboro or vice-versa. For some meets, such a train will divert and lose \ntime up to the maximum; for other meets, the same train will have priority and will keep to the main track \nwith no loss of speed.  \n25 In an operation where the train speeds are uniform, miles would be acceptable criteria. \n26The distance between the intermediate signal and the stop signal must be sufficient to enable a freight \ntrain to stop. \n 4-13\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nproceed and exit the siding at 40 mph, the maximum speed27 permitted \nthrough the turnout.28  \nWhen a train must take a siding it is best to move it off the main track as quickly as \npossible.  Providing a sufficiently long siding with an intermediate signal would facilitate \nthis.  Without the intermediate signal, the train would enter the siding with an indication \nthat it must prepare to stop at the next signal.  This would cause the train to enter the \nsiding at a significantly reduced speed, and take much longer to clear the main track.  A \nshort passenger train may actually accelerate before reaching the intermediate signal if \nthe allowable siding speed is greater than 40 mph. \nIf the siding were too short, the intermediate signal could not be provided because \nthere would be insufficient braking distance for a train to stop.  The signal at the entering \nend of the siding would have to provide the safe braking distance and would display an \n‚Äúapproach‚Äù signal, which would require the train to be prepared to stop at the next signal, \nuntil the other end is cleared for it to continue.  The engineer of a long freight train may \nenter the siding at 40 mph but would immediately begin to brake so that the train would \nbe stopped by the time it reached the leaving end of the siding.  Therefore, the rear of the \ntrain could be crawling into the siding at a very slow speed, depending upon the siding \nlength, and would continue to occupy the single main track for a longer-than-desired \nperiod of time.  Thus, providing long sidings increases line capacity. \nRealistically Locating and Spacing Sidings \nSpacing every siding 15 miles center-to-center is often not possible. Major \nbridges, or clusters of road crossings, and curves may make it too expensive or \noperationally infeasible to place sidings at the ideal locations. When this occurs, a \nlocation should be sought that is free of curves and grade crossings, especially primary \nroad crossings necessary for emergency vehicles.29,30 Even then, such a location may not \nbe found. This is another reason for having long sidings. \nSiding With Number 20 vs. Number 32 Turnout \nThe following analysis explains the decision to plan for Number 20 instead of \nNumber 32 turnouts at both ends of the passing sidings in single-track territory on the \nRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte line. \nNumber 20 Turnouts (45 mph):  A passenger train traveling at 100 mph \nentering a siding to meet another train would be delayed a minimum of five minutes due \nto:  \n                                                 \n27 See footnote 20 above for speed limits; this section pertains to freight trains and assumes No. 20 turnouts.   \n28 The train would then proceed at 40 mph until the rear of the train clears the siding, at which time it could \naccelerate to the maximum authorized speed for the segment of main track. \n29 Major highway at-grade crossings that would be located on a passing track on which freight trains would \nbe expected to remain for more than a few minutes should be grade separated.  This will assure access by \nemergency vehicles. \n30 To avoid adversely delaying highway traffic, the engineer of a train traveling through sidings with \ncrossings should maintain constant communication with the dispatcher so that the train‚Äôs arrival and \npassage through the siding can be made with minimal impact on highway traffic. \n \n 4-14\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Decelerating to 45 mph upon receiving a signal in advance of the turnout; \n‚Ä¢ Moving through the siding at 45 mph (without stopping), and  \n‚Ä¢ Accelerating back to 100 mph.  \nFor passenger train ‚ÄúA‚Äù to be delayed only the minimal five minutes entering the \nsiding, the opposing passenger train ‚ÄúB‚Äù can be no farther than three minutes (4 miles) \nfrom the end of the siding at the moment that train ‚ÄúA‚Äù receives its initial signal to slow \ndown.  Constituting a ‚Äúnonstop meet,‚Äù these maneuvers would require train movements \nso flawless in their timing and choreography as to be only infrequently attainable. \nNumber 32 Turnouts (80 mph):  A passenger train traveling at 100 mph \nentering a siding to meet another train would be delayed a minimum of 1.5 minutes due \nto:  \n‚Ä¢ Decelerating to 80 mph upon receiving a signal in advance of the turnout; \n‚Ä¢ Moving through the siding at 80 mph (without stopping), and  \n‚Ä¢ Accelerating back to 100 mph.  \nFor passenger train ‚ÄúA‚Äù to be delayed only the minimal 1.5 minutes as a result of \ntaking the siding, the opposing passenger train ‚ÄúB‚Äù can be no farther than one minute (1.3 \nmiles) from the end of the siding at the moment that train ‚ÄúA‚Äù receives its initial signal to \nslow down.  These maneuvers would likewise constitute a nonstop meet.  \nBased on historical performance data it is highly likely that few, if any, trains \nwould achieve a nonstop meet with Number 32 turnouts. If the siding spacing is fifteen \nmiles, the opposing train ‚ÄúB‚Äù may be a fraction of a minute to as much as nine minutes \naway from the end of the siding being entered, at the time train ‚ÄúA‚Äù receives its signal to \nslow down.  To the extent that train ‚ÄúB‚Äù is farther than 1.3 miles from the siding when \ntrain ‚ÄúA‚Äù starts decelerating, the installation of Number 32 rather than Number 20 \nturnouts will merely have resulted in Train A‚Äôs coming to a stop more quickly at the end \nof the passing track and waiting longer for Train B, thus yielding minimal benefit in \nreturn for the additional cost.31\nThe most delay time that might be saved by installing a Number 32 turnout in \nplace of a Number 20 turnout at the end of the four-mile sidings would range from zero \n(same as at 45 mph) to 3.5 minutes (5 minutes less 1.5 minutes). However, approximately \nthree minutes is about the best that reasonably could be achieved. Therefore, the added \ncost for Number 32 turnouts would be difficult to justify if only one or two running meets \noccur at a siding each day. However, when the number of passenger meets is five or more \nper day at a siding the potential reduction in the amount of train delays might justify the \ncost. \n                                                 \n31 For trackwork alone, each No. 32 turnout would cost about 50 percent more than a No. 20 turnout \n(capital costs of $228,000 versus $152,000, respectively).  Signaling costs would also be higher for No. 32 \nthan for No. 20 turnouts due to extra machinery and longer interlockings. \n 4-15\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nCoordinating Siding Locations and Curve Relocations \nIf the ideal location of a siding coincides with the location of a curve relocation, \neither the curve relocation should be constructed first, or the siding and the curve \nrelocation should be constructed at the same time. Constructing and then relocating the \nsiding would be an unwarranted expense. Therefore, if adequate siding spacing can be \nmaintained, sidings should be constructed, whenever possible, where no line change is \nlikely. \nLocations will be discussed in Chapter 6 where the installation of a siding could \nnot be changed to avoid possible future relocations. In those instances, a choice was made \nbetween:  \n‚Ä¢ Building a new main track and retaining the current main track in its existing \nlocation as the siding; or  \n‚Ä¢ building a new siding concurrently with relocating the main track. \nFreight Trains Meeting Freight Trains \nA maximum delay criterion for a meet between two freight trains was not \nestablished. The decision as to which opposing freight train would enter a siding would \nbe made while the trains are approaching32 one of the two sidings that are separated by a \nsegment of single track. \nWhile the maximum speed on the S Line is expected to be 50 mph for general \nmerchandise freight trains, the average speed may be approximately 40 mph because of \nthe many curves and grades. At 40 mph it would take a freight train 25 minutes to travel \n15 miles and clear the end of the siding that the opposing freight train is approaching.  \nTwenty-five minutes would be the minimum delay. The average delay would be \ndependent upon the train consist, the condition of the locomotives, and the actual location \nof the freight trains when the determination to take the siding is made. \nLocal Freight Trains \nLocal freight trains must work the various industrial spurs between through-\nrunning trains. A non-signaled siding long enough to hold a local freight train alongside \nthe main track, accessed from hand-operated switches, must be provided if sufficient time \ncannot be provided to enable local freight trains to switch industries by occupying the \nmain track between through trains. Scheduling local freight trains to work in off-peak \ntimes when no or few through trains are operating could be unacceptable to the industries \nbeing served and was not assumed to be a viable option. \nFreight Trains Overtaking Freight Trains \nTypically, main line railroads handle a hierarchy of freight trains, listed below in \ndescending order of precedence: \n1. Intermodal freights (containers and trailers on flat cars); \n                                                 \n32 Or one train is located on the main track adjacent to one of the sidings. \n 4-16\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n2. Manifest freights (merchandise traffic of relatively high value, handled in \nboxcars and other non-intermodal equipment); \n3. Mineral and grain unit trains (coal and other commodities); and \n4. Local freights.  \nBecause this hierarchy exists, railroads typically provide for maneuvers in which \na lower-priority freight waits at a siding for a higher-priority freight to pass it.  Thus, \nfreight trains very often overtake other freight trains. \nSimultaneous Meets and Overtakes \nDepending on the capabilities of the facility and the length and priority of the \ntrains, dispatchers can choreograph still more complex maneuvers than simple meets and \novertakes involving just two trains at a time.  By way of illustration (see Figure 4-1): \nwhere circumstances bring three trains together in opposing directions, and where the \nsiding is long and has an intermediate crossover‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ Two northbound freight trains‚éØ(1) local, (2) intermodal‚éØcan be held in \nthe siding; \n‚Ä¢ (3) A southbound passenger train can operate past the held freights; \n‚Ä¢ (4) The second‚éØhigher priority‚éØfreight can then overtake the local \nfreight; and  \n‚Ä¢ (5) the local can then proceed on its way north.  \nThese maneuvers would constitute but one example of the simultaneous meets \nand overtakes‚éØinvolving three or more trains of any type(s)‚éØthat traffic patterns, \ndispatching expertise, and track capabilities would make necessary and feasible.  \nAppendix C contains an extensive discussion of procedures for dispatching single-track \nlines, as well as examples of complex maneuvers that would occur on an upgraded \nRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor.  \nOperations in Double-Track Territory (Greensboro‚ÄìCharlotte) \nThe largely double-track33 Piedmont Main Line between Greensboro and \nCharlotte today carries a heavy freight volume, on which a marked increase in passenger \ntraffic would be superimposed.  On such a railway, a very large number of trains can be \noperated on two tracks when the speed of the trains is uniform: for example, commuter \nagencies can operate well over 100 trains per day on two tracks. However, when the \nspeed of trains is not uniform, the transit time differentials, not the number of trains, \ncreate the need for ‚Äúovertakes‚Äù‚éØmaneuvers in which a faster train passes a slower train. \nReverse signaling‚éØ allowing both tracks to carry traffic at maximum authorized \nspeeds in both directions‚éØ certainly facilitates use of the second track, when necessary, \nto run around slower trains, maintenance work, local freight trains, or disabled trains. \nNevertheless, where heavy and disparate traffic exists, reverse signaling may not suffice \n                                                 \n33 As pointed out in Chapter 2, some two-fifths of the route-mileage in the Greensboro‚ÄìCharlotte segment \nhas been reduced from double to single track in recent decades. \n 4-17\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nto prevent the great \nspeed differentials \namong various types of \ntrains from slowing the \ntraffic flow, in some \ncases appreciably.  This \noccurs when ‚Äúwindows‚Äù \n(gaps between trains on \nthe other track) in the \nopposing traffic are too \nshort to allow the faster \ntrain to run around the \nslower train between \ncrossovers without \nstopping opposing \ntraffic. The simulations \nbetween Greensboro \nand Charlotte project \njust such a situation. \nFigure 4-1: Example of Three-Train Maneuver  \n(Long Siding With Intermediate Crossover) \n \nConsequently, \nthe installation of \nadditional tracks in \ncertain areas will be \nessential. A continuous \nfour-track, or even a \nthree-track system, \ncannot be justified in \nthis corridor, but in \nlimited instances, a third \ntrack is justified. \n 4-18\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nPassing lanes are added to two-lane highways when traffic becomes heavy \nenough that faster vehicles can no longer use the opposing lane to overtake the slower \nvehicles. Similarly, railroads must add sidings or additional tracks at locations where \ntraffic is heavy.  \nHowever, instead of directional sidings along each main track (see ‚Äúsingle siding‚Äù \nand ‚Äúdouble siding‚Äù in Figure 4-2), bi-directional center sidings (‚Äúcenter siding‚Äù in \naccompanying figure) between the two main tracks are recommended. Two sidings at a \nlocation, the double siding, intended to handle simultaneous overtakes, would be used \ninfrequently. Therefore, four-mile center-sidings located between the two main tracks are \nproposed between Greensboro and Charlotte. \nFigure 4-2: Siding Options in Double-Track Territory \n(Dashed lines represent paths of trains diverting to siding.) \n \nThe center sidings would enable freight trains to be passed by passenger trains \nwhen clear windows are not available on the other track. Figure 4-3 demonstrates the \ndegree to which a center siding enhances operating flexibility with an example consisting \nof three trains (a northbound passenger train overtaking a northbound freight train, and a \nsouthbound passenger train). \nNormally, only one train would be slowed or stopped when the overtaking \nmaneuver occurred. However, the center sidings do not eliminate the possibility that, \nunder certain infrequent circumstances‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ Passenger trains may have to divert to the opposite track to overtake freight \ntrains, or \n 4-19\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Freight trains may be unable to use a center siding because another train is \noccupying the siding, or; \n‚Ä¢ Maintenance activities may require unscheduled diversions of passenger \ntracks.34 \n \nFigure 4-3: Time Sequence of Moves ‚Äì Northbound Passenger Train  \nOvertaking Northbound Freight in Center Siding ‚ÄúB to A,‚Äù  \nSouthbound Passenger Train on Opposing Track \n\"A\"\n\"B\"\n10 20 30 40 50\nF2\nP2\nP1\nNorth\nPassenger\nTrain P1\nruns north\nwithout delay\nNorthbound\nFreight F2\nenters siding and\nwaits until\nnorthbound\npassenger passes\nTime ‚ÄîMinutes\n Passenger Train P2\nruns south without\ndelay\nD\nis\nta\nnc\ne\nP2\nP2\nP1\nP1\nF2\n \n                                                 \n34 None of the illustrative dispatching situations broached in this monograph should be regarded as \ninterpreting, contravening, or otherwise affecting present and future operating agreements between a State \nand other railroad users.   \n 4-20\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n Each time a center siding is used by a freight train, a passenger train would not \nhave to divert, thereby saving a minimum of about three minutes for a passenger train \neach time a diversion is avoided.  \nThus, although center sidings cannot cure all possible operating problems on a \nbusy double-track railroad with diverse traffic, they can‚éØif properly designed and \nsited‚éØsignificantly contribute to the fluidity and reliability of the line under projected \nYear 2020 traffic conditions. \nAdditional Background on Train Dispatching \nAppendix C provides additional information on the complex decision rules for \ntrain dispatching under single- and double-track conditions, with a variety of traffic types.  \nReflecting the variety of situations that may arise on a railroad in which random freight \nmovements are superimposed on scheduled freight, intercity passenger, and commuter \ntrains, these rules are of interest because they influenced the simulations and have \nimplications for the design of the contemplated improvements.  \nResults of the Operating Analysis \nAppendixes B and C present the detailed results of the train performance \ncalculator and train interaction analyses, respectively.  This section excerpts the salient \nresults of those investigations. \nTo provide for four-hour, twenty-five minute Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte service with \nfive intermediate stops and 90 percent on-time performance would require a pad of about \none-half hour, broken down as follows: \nTable 4-1: Pad Requirement for Reliable Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Service \nComponent of Pad Minutes\nTypical seven percent pad used in analyses of double- or multi-track routes 16.4 \nSingle track conflicts (average total delay time per train of 9.5 minutes, plus an \nallowance of 20 percent to cover excessive delay situations; see page 4-12) \n11.4 \n \nCongestion on the heavily-trafficked P Line 3.9 \nTotal pad required 31.7 \n \nTable 4-2, summarizing the results of selected TPC runs, clearly indicates that the \nonly system configuration that would meet the States‚Äô trip time goals for the Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte Corridor‚éØwhile providing adequate pad for reliable service‚éØwould entail: \n‚Ä¢ Maximum authorized speeds of 110 mph; \n‚Ä¢ Trainsets with two locomotives and six cars.

The \npresent chapter summarizes the entire investment program and then focuses on the \nimprovements and design standards that would apply consistently through the corridor to \nsuch railway subsystems as track, signaling, highway-rail grade crossings, and stations.  \nThe next chapter focuses on projected site-specific investments, like sidings and other \ntrack reconfigurations. \nThe Contemplated Improvements in Brief \nThe goal of the contemplated improvements would be to provide five-stop intercity \nrail passenger service in less than four hours and 25 minutes between the city centers of \nRichmond and Charlotte. Achieving the goal requires the removal of about three hours \nfrom the current schedule of Amtrak‚Äôs Carolinian between Richmond and Charlotte,1 for a \ntravel time reduction of about two-fifths.  A performance improvement of this magnitude \nwould require coordinated betterments in all infrastructure departments‚éØespecially track \nstructure and alignment, signaling, grade crossings, stations, and equipment storage and \nservicing facilities‚éØwith implementation of both system-wide and site-specific projects.  \nOf course, a carefully designed program to acquire a suitable fleet of vehicles would \nnecessarily complement the fixed facility investments. \nContributing to achievement of the trip time goals would be the re-establishment of \nrail passenger service to Raleigh through Richmond‚Äôs Main Street Station, and the \nassumed restoration of service on the abandoned, 88-mile S Line between Centralia, \nVirginia and Norlina.2  The tracks would have to be restored, new passing sidings \nprovided, and bridges replaced or rebuilt. The existing, operational rail segments between \nMain Street Station and Centralia, and between Norlina and Raleigh, would be upgraded to \nsupport the requisite passenger train speeds.  If included in the project, restoration of the S \nLine would save some 34 miles, or one-fifth, of the existing distance between Petersburg \nand Raleigh, with a concomitant travel time improvement.  Other time savings would rely \non a host of smaller projects, such as curve realignments. \nSatisfying the trip time goal for passenger rail service on a consistent basis‚éØ while \npreserving and enhancing the dependability of the important and growing freight traffic \n                                                 \n1 The Carolinian currently operates between New York‚Äôs Pennsylvania Station, Washington, D.C., \nRichmond, and Charlotte.  The Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte travel time is 7 hours, 39 minutes southbound and 7 \nhours, 26 minutes northbound; these timings are based on the Staples Mill Road station location in \nRichmond. \n2 See the section in Chapter 1 entitled, ‚ÄúImportant Note on the Environmental Process.‚Äù \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-2\n                                                \nand the potential for commuter services to share the line‚éØwould require improvements \nthat would increase rail capacity at strategic locations.  Reduced trip times and increased \ncapacity would enable the high-speed service to operate reliably without adversely \naffecting or being delayed by the large number of long freight trains or by frequently-\nstopping commuter trains, where the latter service is implemented. \nImprovements to station platforms, buildings, parking, or access facilities can \nenhance the passenger interface with the rail system, reduce door-to-door trip times, \nincrease rail line capacity, and reduce line-haul schedules. This study focused on station \nimprovements that would yield as many of these benefits as possible, and envisioned some \nrelocation of station facilities to improve access and better serve potential markets.  In such \ninstances as Raleigh, Greensboro, and Charlotte, the contemplated station improvements \nwould require track configuration modifications.  While sometimes complex and costly to \nbuild, these station investments are prerequisite to the establishment of a competent \nservice.  Indeed, without proper arrangements for passenger access and train throughput, \nthe other contemplated betterments (except for those adding to safety) lose their reason for \nbeing, since upgraded mobility for the traveling public would be the underlying \njustification for considering the entire effort.  Other prerequisites to the project include \nmore effective highway-rail grade crossing treatments, selective right-of-way fencing, and \nthe vehicle acquisition and support programs mentioned above. \nCorridor-Wide Improvements and Standards \nThis section describes investments that would affect major railway components and \noccur on a corridor-wide basis.  Also included is a description of corridor-wide design \nstandards for certain components that would be implemented on a site-specific basis. \nTrack Structure \nCurrent Status of H and P Lines \nThe line segments between Raleigh, Greensboro, and Charlotte‚éØowned by the \nNorth Carolina Railroad, operated by the NS, and already carrying passenger trains‚éØ \nserve as important freight routes in both north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest traffic lanes, and have \nbeen maintained to facilitate safe and expeditious freight and passenger movements.  In \nthose segments, this study assumes that the freight railroads, as owners and/or operators of \nthe fixed plant, will continue to maintain it in the state of good repair that exists today.3,  4\nAccordingly, between Raleigh, Greensboro, and Charlotte, except as noted below, the \ninvestment requirements contained in this monograph do not include replacement in kind \nof such existing track components as ties and rail‚Äîin railroad parlance, ‚Äúprogram \n \n3 The assertion that the H and P Lines are in a ‚Äústate of good repair‚Äù reflects the limited field investigations \nundertaken for this study.  More detailed inspection, analysis, and design work will be needed to precisely \nestablish the modifications necessary to qualify these lines for the types of service contemplated in this \nmonograph.  \n4 The sharing of incremental maintenance costs to support the higher speeds contemplated in this study, is \noutside the scope of this monograph. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-3\n                                                \nmaintenance.‚Äù  In addition, the study did not include the incremental costs, primarily \nsurfacing, to enable the existing track structure to comply with the geometric standards for \nsafety and ride quality at 110 mph top speeds. \nLocations in Which Upgrading Is Assumed \nOn the other hand, in the Richmond‚ÄìCentralia, Norlina‚ÄìRaleigh, and Raleigh‚Äì\nFetner segments, this monograph provides for a significant upgrade, with replacement of \nrails and other track components to assure safe, expeditious passenger and freight service. \nInstallation of Premium Ties and Fasteners \nThis study has concluded, based on the simulations described in Chapter 4 and \nAppendix B, that fulfillment of the trip time goals would require the use of tilt trains \ncapable of operating at seven inches of unbalanced superelevation and an MAS of 110 \nmph.  To assure stability, ride quality, and complete safety when these added forces are \napplied to the track structure, such an operating regime would necessitate the installation of \nconcrete ties and premium fasteners on curves in which the trains would operate at greater \nthan five inches of unbalanced superelevation.5  Preliminary analysis indicates that tilt \ntrains would operate at between five and seven inches of unbalanced superelevation on \napproximately 160 curves or approximately 90 track-miles of curves.  Allowing ten \npercent for the approaches to curves or for short stretches connecting adjacent curves, 100 \nmiles of concrete ties and premium fasteners would be required to safely and efficiently \noperate tilt trains in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor. The costs for these upgraded ties \nand fasteners have been included in the cost estimates for the ‚Äúcurve adjustment program‚Äù \nin Table 5-1 and in Table 7-1. \nSpecifications for Continuous Welded Rail Installation \nContinuous welded rail, as commonly installed in the United States, has \ndemonstrated a tendency toward buckling at times of intense heat, due to the tremendous \nforces that can build up within the track structure.  Current practice on the Northeast \nCorridor is to reduce passenger train speeds in extremely hot weather (i.e., over 95 \ndegrees), in part as a safety precaution against such tendencies.6  Such practices, while \nprudent, also detract from the schedule reliability and marketability of high-speed rail in \nthe summertime, thereby potentially undermining the inherent advantages of the service.  \nIn the detailed design of all-new track construction contemplated for the Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte Corridor, most particularly in the rebuilding of the S Line, it is recommended \nthat state-of-the-art techniques for designing continuous welded rail track ‚éØincluding the \nbest practices in Japan,7 France, and other countries‚éØreceive careful scrutiny and \n \n5 Solely to minimize initial capital costs, wooden ties are assumed for the remainder of the trackage.  Suitable \ntransitions would be provided between the concrete and wooden tie sections.  If sufficient funds prove to be \navailable, installation of concrete ties throughout the corridor would be beneficial. \n6 Protection of older portions of the electrical catenary can also enter into these summertime speed \nrestrictions. \n7 For example, the Japanese Shinkansen lines employ expansion joints that relieve stress in the continuous \nwelded rails and assure no degradation in service year-round. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-4\ncomparison with standard American practices, so as to assure complete safety and \nuninterrupted high-speed capabilities throughout the year.   \nCurve Realignments \nThe recommended alignment improvements‚éØdiscussed in detail in Chapter 6 and \nAppendix A‚éØwould allow higher train speeds to be sustained over longer distances.   \nBackground \nThe rail lines comprising the corridor were built between the mid-19th and the early \n20th century. Although a few line relocations have been constructed, the corridor still has a \nsignificant number of curves.  At many locations, adjacent communities have developed in \na manner that precludes reducing the track curvature through relocation and other \nmodifications.  Also, environmental concerns may make other potential track alignment \nimprovements challenging.   \nDespite these challenges, and even if tilting equipment is used, the operational \nsimulations revealed that a trip time goal of less than four hours and twenty-five minutes \nbetween Richmond and Charlotte would necessitate changing the degree of curvature and \nother features of selected existing curves, and relocating selected sections of the line.  \nThese modifications can be applied individually or in combination: \n‚Ä¢ Increase superelevation to the maximum allowable for a particular track \nalignment; \n‚Ä¢ Increase the amount of unbalanced superelevation used to calculate \nspeeds through curves to minimize the need for physically shifting the \ntrack;  \n‚Ä¢ Modify spirals (the length of track that provides a smooth transition \nfrom tangent track to curved track) to provide a smoother ride; \n‚Ä¢ Reduce the degree of curvature either within the existing right-of-way \nor by acquiring a limited amount of land outside the right-of-way, to \nease speed restrictions that adversely affect trip time; and \n‚Ä¢ Relocate limited sections of the rail line in a cost-effective and \nenvironmentally sensitive manner to eliminate sharp curves.  \nSometimes, multiple curves can be ameliorated or eliminated in a single \nrelocation project. \nThe work required to modify the curves can be categorized into four levels of shift: \n‚Ä¢ Less than six inches: these changes can normally occur during planned \nsurfacing and line maintenance activities. \n‚Ä¢ Between six and 36 inches: most of the realignment tasks fall in this \ncategory.  Although shifts greater than six inches are assumed to require \nspecific scheduled work outside of the normal maintenance \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-5\n                                                \nrequirements, those under 36 inches can usually be accommodated \nwithin the existing rail alignment;  \n‚Ä¢ Between 36 inches and ten feet.  Shifts in this category can fall \nsomewhat outside the existing rail alignment, but in most cases would \nnot require construction of significant new roadbed; and \n‚Ä¢ Over ten feet.  In a limited number of instances the curves must be \nrelocated in excess of 10 feet to obtain the desired spiral or \nsuperelevation modifications. In those instances it is assumed that \nsignificant levels of new roadbed will be constructed. \nOf these four levels of realignment, the ‚Äúcurve adjustment program‚Äù comprises \nlevels (1), (2), and a portion of (3); the ‚Äúcurve relocation program‚Äù incorporates major \nexcursions outside the right-of-way that would include a portion of level (3) and all of \nlevel (4).   \nA comparison of the curve adjustment and curve relocation programs (as \nsummarized in Table 5-1 and Table 5-2, respectively) shows that the relocations are \nrelatively few, and that the total cost of the many contemplated adjustments is almost \ndouble that of the relocations.  Chapter 6 provides further details about the individual \nprojects of both types. \nCriteria for Realignments \nTo maximize performance while fully adhering to safety requirements and the \ndictates of passenger comfort, all the altered curves would have geometric characteristics \nmeeting the following criteria: \n‚Ä¢ Maximum actual superelevation8 should not exceed six inches. \n‚Ä¢ Actual superelevation was chosen in increments commensurate with the \nspeed assumed to be authorized for each curve, and with the runoff rates \nspecified by CSXT for the segments between Main Street Station and \nRaleigh, and by NS for the segments between Raleigh and Charlotte, \nrespectively. \n‚Ä¢ Maximum unbalanced superelevation should not exceed seven inches, \nwhich assumes the use of tilting equipment.  As demonstrated in \nChapter 4, this system design standard is essential to fulfilling the trip \ntime goals.9 \n‚Ä¢ Maximum lateral acceleration parallel to the floorboards should not \nexceed 0.15 g. \n \n8 For definitions of engineering terms used in this section, see the Glossary toward the end of Volume I of \nthis monograph. \n9 Of course, the actual (as opposed to the simulated) use of tilting equipment at unbalanced superelevations \ngreater than five inches would require the express approval of FRA‚Äôs Office of Safety.   \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ For conventional coach equipment at a theoretical six inches of \nunbalanced superelevation, the roll angle should be 2.87 degrees. \n \nTable 5-1: Curve Adjustment Program  \n(with Cost Estimates.

Responding to these capacity considerations, the \nadditional and reconfigured trackage contemplated in this study would provide a degree of \nreliability to match the speed capabilities of the upgraded and reconstructed line. \nThe types of capacity improvements contemplated for implementation are site-\nspecific, and are discussed further below, and in Appendix G.  In general, they include: \n‚Ä¢ The assumed restoration of the previously abandoned S Line between \nCentralia and Norlina (a capacity addition because it would parallel and \naugment the existing heavily-trafficked A Line); \n‚Ä¢ Construction of second or third tracks and siding tracks at strategic \nlocations; \n‚Ä¢ Reconfiguration of switching stations (interlockings) to optimize \noperating flexibility; and \n‚Ä¢ Accompanying modifications to signaling and train control systems. \nThese capacity-related capital improvement projects would enable the rail system \nto accommodate the projected intercity and commuter passenger service and speed \nincreases, and would maintain the quality of freight service on the line.  Nevertheless, even \nwith the improvements, proper management of this busy, largely single-track railroad \nwould require all the concerned operators to coordinate their scheduling and dispatching \nprocedures in a straightforward, consistent, and collegial manner.  \nEquipment \nHigh-speed locomotives and coaches have yet to be selected for the Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte Corridor.  It is, of course, essential that planning for vehicle investments be \ncarefully coordinated with planning for infrastructure improvements, and that the \nRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte rolling stock be fully compatible with that providing intercity \npassenger train service in the Northeast Corridor, between Richmond and Washington, and \nbetween the Richmond/Petersburg metropolitan region and Hampton Roads.   This \ncompatibility would not only provide flexibility to the intercity passenger rail operator but \nalso assure direct through services‚éØwithout change of trains‚éØbetween the Northeast and \n \n10 Cf. the section in Chapter 4 entitled ‚ÄúOperations in Single-Track Territory‚Äù \n11 Assuming the performance equivalent of two Diesel locomotives per train, and including five intermediate \nstops. \n12 Intermodal freights averaged 40 to 42 mph average and conventional freight trains 35 to 38 mph in the \nsimulation. Commuter trains, if they operate between Concord and Charlotte, would average 35 to 37 mph. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-9\n                                                \nSoutheast Corridors.  These through services would, in turn, add to passenger convenience \nand leverage the revenues and profits (or minimize any deficits) attached to the various \npassenger rail operations. 13  \nSignaling and Train Control \nAs indicated in Chapter 2, most of the route-mileage east and north of Greensboro \non the H and S lines lacks signals entirely, and the P line‚Äôs signaling system does not allow \nfor speeds over 79 mph.  Thus, major signal system upgrades would be necessary to \nefficiently handle increased train traffic on the Corridor and to permit improved intercity \npassenger service with greater safety.  These improvements also would enable freight \nservice, and any potential commuter service, to safely and efficiently operate on the same \ntracks.  In anticipation of increased train speed, a revised block layout and new signal \naspects would support operations up to 110 miles per hour. 14  The signal system would use \nmicroprocessor-based track circuits and control/indication equipment.  Except in the \nlower-speed territory between Richmond and Centralia (10.7 miles), continuous cab \nsignals would be installed and all locomotives operating on the line would be equipped \nwith Automatic Train Control.15  Reverse signaling would be installed throughout the \ncorridor.  Interlockings would be remotely controlled from Jacksonville, Florida on the S \nLine and from Greenville, South Carolina for the H and P Lines.  \nThe new signal system would improve the safety and reliability of all train services, \nhelp to control maintenance-related operating costs, and enable higher speed train \noperations.  All freight, commuter, and intercity rail locomotives operating over the P, H, \nor S Lines would be required to have working electronic devices to implement these \nimportant safety features. 16  \nStation Improvement Projects \nRationale \nRepresenting the beginning and end of each passenger‚Äôs experience with the \nrailroad, stations can serve as the focus for local participation and investment, as image-\nbuilders for train service, and as enhancements to passenger comfort and convenience.  \nStation betterments‚éØincluding totally new stations as well as tracks, platforms, \nbuildings, parking, and access facilities at existing locations‚éØserve multiple purposes.  By \n \n13 For an explanation of how through Southeast Corridor services benefit the rail mode, see chapter 8 of the \nFRA 1997 report. \n14 The braking distance for a 110 mph passenger train is essentially equal to that of a 60 mph freight train. \n15 These would be legally required for operations over 79 mph; see in Chapter 4, the section ‚ÄúBackground: \nSignaling and Train Control.‚Äù   \n16 Both the CSXT and the NS have significant locomotive fleets already equipped for compatibility with cab \nsignals, and are including cab signal equipment on new locomotive purchases.  Since the Richmond-\nCentralia segment would not become cab-signal territory, the CSXT coal trains using that segment only \nwould not need to be so equipped under this study‚Äôs assumptions. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-10\neasing passengers‚Äô interface with the rail system, such improvements can reduce the \naccess/egress portion of door-to-door trip times.  Station location and platform  \n \nimprovements, combined with track and interlocking improvements, also contribute to \nincreased rail line capacity (hence on-time performance) and can materially reduce line-\nhaul schedule timings. In some circumstances, station facilities, parking, and amenities can \ndirectly generate net revenue for a rail system or its sponsors.  For all these reasons, \nthoughtful station design and development efforts are essential‚éØrather than ancillary‚éØto \nthe operational and economic success of a corridor like that between Richmond and \nCharlotte.  \nThe nature of the improvements that would be appropriate at each location will \nvary on a site-specific basis, as detailed in Chapter 6.  In developing concepts and costs, \nthis study has focused on tracks, platforms, and pedestrian bridges and tunnels; station \narchitecture, amenities, parking, and site design were generally outside the scope of this \neffort, as were the institutional partnerships that have proven so important in station \nrevitalizations elsewhere.  The corridor partners would, however, need to devote \nsignificant resources to these important topics. \nList of Projected Stations \nTable 5-3 lists the stations projected for an upgraded Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte corridor.  \nFinal decisions on station locations, and the frequency of service at each station, will rest \nwith the States, the localities, and the rail service operator.  Descriptions of these stations \nappear sequentially in Chapter 6. \nTypes of Station Improvements \nThe improvements at each station would be site-specific. Because stations are \nintegral to any rail passenger system, however, this study assumed the adoption of certain \nprinciples of station design that would apply regardless of the particularities of each site.  \nThese principles include: \nStation Platforms \nStations were assumed to have low-level platforms. Where usable low-level \nplatforms already exist and no alignment or track configuration changes are foreseen, \nexisting platforms would remain in place, without rehabilitation.   In all other cases, new \nplatforms would be built or existing ones upgraded.  \nWhere justified by ridership, the incremental costs of high (versus low) platforms at \neach of the more heavily patronized stations‚éØincluding the costs to protect the flow of \nfreight traffic‚éØshould be carefully assessed against high platforms‚Äô undeniable service \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-11\nTable 5-3: Contemplated Stations on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor  \n   Status  Assumed Owner \nMile- \npost17 Location18\nMetro \nArea \nPopula-\ntion19 E\nxi\nst\nin\ng,\n R\nes\nto\nre\nd,\n \nan\nd/\nor\n R\neo\npe\nne\nd \nA\nss\num\ned\n \nR\nel\noc\nat\nio\nn \nA\nss\num\ned\n N\new\n S\nto\np \nAssumed User Land Station Parking \nS0 Richmond‚ÄìMain St. Sta.  ‚Ä¢   SEC operator20 City of Richmond \nS22.0 Petersburg \n997,000 \n‚Ä¢21   SEC operator CSXT ‚Äì Leased to Amtrak \nS113.8 Henderson 16,095 ‚Ä¢   SEC operator Currently - Private/Proposed - City \nH80.4 Raleigh  ‚Ä¢  SEC operator NCRR/ TTA22\nCity of \nRaleigh \nNCRR/ \nTTA \nH72.7 Cary ‚Ä¢   SEC operator City of Cary City and NCRR \nH54.7 Durham \n1,188,000 \n ‚Ä¢  SEC operator NCDOT/City of Durham \nH21.5 Burlington ‚Ä¢   SEC operator NCRR NCDOT NCRR \nH0.1 Greensboro  ‚Ä¢  SEC operator City of Greensboro \n299.2 High Point \n1,252,000 \n‚Ä¢   SEC operator NCRR \nP333.3 Salisbury ‚Ä¢   SEC operator Historic Salisbury Foundation, Inc. \nP348.9 Kannapolis ‚Ä¢   SEC operator NCRR Disputed NCRR \nP367.1 I-485   ‚Ä¢ SEC operator, Commuter \nNew Station ‚Äì institutional \narrangement to be determined \nP377.8 Charlotte  ‚Ä¢  SEC operator,    Commuter Charlotte/NCDOT \nP383.2 Charlotte Airport \n1,499,000 \n  ‚Ä¢ SEC operator New Station ‚Äì institutional arrangement to be determined \nTotal population, Richmond‚Äì\nCharlotte Corridor only23 4,952,095  \n                                                 \n17 Relocated stations will show different milepost numbers than are reflected in Table 2-4. \n18 Chapter 7 specifies what costs categories are included for each station. \n19 Populations are for Metropolitan Statistical Areas or for the city or town‚éØwhichever is the largest \napplicable to the station.

To implement the transportation provisions of \nADA, the U.S. Department of Transportation has issued rules that \nrequire all intercity rail stations to meet ADA standards by 2010, \nwith the exception of flag stops. These standards include: \naccessible routes, signage to include Braille, full accessibility to both north- and \nsouthbound platforms, new platforms with tactile edging and striping, modified ticket \ncounters, updated public address and telephone systems, and accessible restrooms. \nFigure 5-1:  \nSchematic of Gantlet Track \n \nTo meet these standards, various improvements were assumed to be implemented \nat Corridor stations, including but not limited to: new platforms, new lighting and \ncanopies, and improved public address systems. These actions would make the stations \nfully accessible to disabled passengers. \nWhile assuming that the intercity rail passenger operator, NCDOT, and VDRPT \nwill accomplish the ADA modifications, this study has not identified the related costs. \nParking and Access/Egress \nSince today‚Äôs inventory of parking spaces most likely would not accommodate the \nprojected passenger volumes, enhanced train service would necessitate expanded parking \nfacilities at existing intercity stations along the Corridor.  New stations serving intercity \ntraffic (for instance, Charlotte I-485) would, of course, need parking facilities as well. \nBeyond the obvious requirements for parking, all facets of passenger \naccess/egress‚éØincluding automobile, taxi, and bus traffic patterns in the station vicinities, \nas well as rail transit and pedestrian facilities where applicable‚éØwill require careful \nscrutiny.  Thus, proper integration of the new service into each community served will \nnecessitate planning and design work of some consequence.  Since this type of planning \n                                                                                                                                                    \n23 The important points served by through services, such as Washington, Baltimore, and other Northeast \nCorridor population centers, are not included in this total. \n24 Where freight trains would use of a track adjacent to a high platform, clearance needs may mandate a \n‚Äúgantlet track‚Äù ‚éØa pair of rails sharing the same ties as, but offset between 12 and 24 inches from, the rails \nof the platform track. Any freight trains with high and wide loads would then divert to the gantlet track, thus \nmaking the high platform feasible.  Depending on site-specific conditions, such as the frequency of high and \nwide freight loads, such a gantlet track can cost on the order of one-half to one million dollars for track work \nand signaling the turnouts at either end.  See Figure 5-1. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-13\n                                                \nfell outside the scope of this study, the costs associated with parking and other modes of \npassenger access/egress are not included in the estimates in Table 7-1. \nEquipment Support Facilities \nIn the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor as in any other passenger rail operation, \nadequate provisions for equipment servicing and storage are prerequisite to a successful \noperation.  This study therefore projected two maintenance and layover facilities, at \nRaleigh and Charlotte.25\nNCDOT Raleigh Storage Yard and Servicing Facility \nThe existing facilities, located adjacent to the S Line between Southern Junction \nand Edgeton, would be expanded and upgraded to accommodate the increased level of \ndaily passenger service‚éØfive Raleigh‚ÄìCharlotte round trips, instead of the one presently \noperated.26  Access to the main line would also be expedited, as described in Chapter 6. \nCharlotte Storage Yard and Servicing Facility \nAn efficient storage yard and maintenance facility would be built in the vicinity of \nCharlotte Airport Station to store trains, both during the day and overnight, to enable \nvarious equipment cleaning functions to be performed, and to accomplish assigned \nmaintenance functions.  The storage yard would provide sufficient yard storage capacity to \nhandle overnight layovers for three trains scheduled to depart Charlotte the next day, and \nto store equipment awaiting maintenance. Since the designated Southeast Corridor extends \nbeyond Charlotte to Atlanta and beyond, additional space should be preserved for the \nstorage of trainsets that might protect a future Charlotte‚ÄìAtlanta service.27\nGrade Crossing Improvements \nChapter 2 presents some basic information on highway-railroad grade crossings in \nthe Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor.  With respect to future grade crossing safety activities, \nthis section presents some engineering considerations and describes a set of actions that \nwould complement the other corridor betterments contemplated in the monograph. \nPlanning Principles \nImplementation of high-speed rail on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor would \nresult in higher train speeds and frequencies over existing rail lines, and could involve \nrestoration of train service on the now-abandoned S Line.  For these reasons, highway-rail \ncrossing safety would require concerted attention as the planning and design process \n \n25 In addition, a servicing and storage facility is being planned for downtown Richmond near Main Street \nStation, primarily for the use of trains between Richmond and points north.  This Richmond facility could \nalso be used for an early morning train originating at Richmond for Raleigh and Charlotte, or a late evening \narrival in Richmond from North Carolina points. \n26 These Raleigh‚ÄìCharlotte round trips, utilizing Raleigh as their northerly turnaround point, are in addition \nto the through services to and from points north of Raleigh. See Tables 2-5 and 3-1. \n27 For the status of potential Charlotte‚ÄìAtlanta intercity rail passenger improvements, see Chapter 3 (under \n‚ÄúCorridor-Type Services‚Äù); and the  ‚ÄúSupplement: Background Materials‚Äù at the end of this volume, under \n‚ÄúFunding for Planning an Extension of the SEC to Atlanta and Macon, Georgia.‚Äù \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-14\ncontinues.  In particular, each crossing would require study, both individually and in \ncombination with neighboring crossings, to assess the degree of risk that it poses, the \nopportunities for mitigating that risk, and the cost-effectiveness of the various treatment \noptions.  ‚ÄúRisk‚Äù depends on a host of factors, including the geometry of the crossing, the \ntype, speed, and volume of motor vehicle and rail traffic, and the protective devices in \nplace or available.  Community needs, such as access to nearby properties, obviously \ndemand careful attention.    \nAny comprehensive grade crossing plan needs to address the full range of \nimprovement options.  These include consolidating groups of crossings; grade-separating \nheavily-used crossings; closing selected crossings; and applying known techniques for \nreducing hazards at the remaining crossings.  In addition, proper treatments must be \napplied to private crossings, where fatalities can and do occur despite the infrequency of \nuse by motor vehicles. \nSpecific Considerations \nMany engineering and operational considerations would affect the details of a \ncomprehensive grade crossing plan.  The following are just a few examples: \nTrain Speeds \nAll other things being equal, the highest level of protection would be provided at \nthose remaining crossings though which passenger trains would operate at speeds greater \nthan 90 mph.   \nConstant Warning Times \nHigher train speeds would require the timing in the track circuits (which actuate \ngrade crossing gates and flashing lights) to be lengthened to initiate warnings sufficiently \nin advance of the arrival of the faster trains.  Faster trains take less time to traverse the \nlength of the circuit, and reach the crossing sooner than slower trains.   At crossings with \nfixed circuits, warning time must be set for the fastest possible train.  This creates a \npotential problem: when a slow train approaches the crossing, the gates are held down for \nan inordinate amount of time. Some motorists lose patience with the situation, and drive \naround the gate at the risk of a collision. \nConstant Warning Time circuits can offset this problem by automatically adjusting \nthe length of the warning to a time appropriate to the speed of each individual oncoming \ntrain.  The system has the ability to determine the speed of an approaching train, and \ninitiate the crossing warning cycle so that a predetermined period of warning will have \ntranspired when the train reaches the crossing, regardless of the train speed.  \nFour-Quadrant Gates; Median Barriers \nAnother innovation with application to many crossings is a system of four-quadrant \ngates, wherein four gates, instead of two, are lowered across the traffic lanes, blocking both \ndirections on both sides, and median barriers are placed down the center of the roadway.  \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-15\n                                                \nAs North Carolina‚Äôs Sealed Corridor Initiative has graphically proven,28 four-quadrant \ngates and median barriers effectively prevent motor vehicle operators from driving around \nthe gates after they are lowered.   \nEffect on Train Speed of Crossings Located on Curves \nRaising the MAS on a curve containing a grade crossing creates serious concerns.  \nIn numerous instances, an increase in superelevation would be necessary to attain the \nprojected increase in train speed planned over the crossings and to reduce the lateral \nacceleration forces felt by rail passengers. \nWith superelevation, the outside rail on each track on the curve is raised as much as \nsix inches above the level of the inside rail.  With a multiple-track crossing, which many \ncrossings are and would be after the improvements, a series of inclines would need to be \ncrossed, one between the rails of each track, and a dip from the slope of one track to the \nnext.  There is also likely to be a slope upward to the tracks on each side, the one on the \noutside of the curve being significantly greater than the one on the inside of the curve.  \nThis is not practical on a heavily-traveled street or highway, and may require that these \ncrossings be closed, or grade-separated.  Analysis will be required to develop a \nrecommendation for each crossing. \nSidings and Crossings \nSidings, either to be constructed new or extended, should be placed to minimize the \nnumber of grade crossings that would be blocked by freight or passenger trains stopped \nwaiting to meet or be overtaken by another train.  Conversely, planning for crossing \nimprovements needs to take the location of sidings into consideration.  This is more than a \nmatter of convenience to motor vehicle flow: community needs for access by emergency \nmotor vehicles demand careful attention in the siting, treatment, or elimination of \nhighway-rail grade crossings. \nContemplated Grade Crossing Program \nBased on all the considerations described above, the study team developed a list of \ngrade crossing actions that would support the trip-time goals and safety prerequisites of \nhigh-speed rail development in the Corridor.  These grade crossing actions appear in Table \n5-4 (for public crossings) and Table 5-5 (for private crossings).  In these tables, the \ncontemplated dispositions are expressed as percentages of the universe of crossings \naddressed by the study.  These possible dispositions include:  \n‚Ä¢ Elimination, which can be effected by‚éØ \no Closing the crossing to vehicular traffic; \no Providing a grade separation; or \no Relocating the railroad; \n \n \n28 The Sealed Corridor Initiative is described in Chapter 2. \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-16\n \n \n \n‚Ä¢ Upgrading of protection devices, for example from crossbucks to gates and \nflashing lights, or from gates that cover only half the road in each direction, \nto four-quadrant gates that cover the entire road, thereby blocking drivers \nfrom ‚Äúrunning around‚Äù the crossing. \n‚Ä¢ Keeping the crossing as-is, where the level of protection is already \nappropriate for the contemplated train speeds and road traffic levels; \n‚Ä¢ Restoring an abandoned crossing, with upgraded protection from historic \nlevels; \n‚Ä¢ Expanding or moving a crossing to accord with the engineering \nimprovements described in other sections of this monograph‚éØfor example, \nnew sidings or changes to curves; or \n‚Ä¢ Adding well-protected crossings where they do not exist today‚éØ normally \nowing to the other engineering improvements.  As shown in Table 5-4, the \nratio of crossing eliminations (closures, separations, and relocations) to \ncrossing additions for the Corridor as a whole is projected as four to one.  \n \n \nTable 5-4: Contemplated Disposition of Public Grade Crossings \n(Expressed as Percentages of Total Crossings Studied by Segment) \nEliminate Retain Existing \nSegment Close Separate \nRelocate \nRailroad \nUpgrade \nProtection\nKeep \nas-is \nRestore and \nupgrade \nExpand \nor move, \nwith \nupgrade\nAdd \nand \nprotect\nTotals by \nSegment\nRichmond‚ÄìCentralia  \n(Active S Line) 10% 0% 0% 0% 80% 0% 10% 0% 100% \nCentralia‚ÄìPetersburg‚ÄìNorlina \n (Restored S Line)(See footnote 29.) 3% 3% 6% 0% 0% 83% 0% 5% 100% \nNorlina‚ÄìRaleigh \n(Active S Line) 1% 1% 0% 49% 11% 0% 38% 0% 100% \nRaleigh‚Äì Greensboro (H Line) 1% 3% 0% 55% 26% 0% 14% 2% 100% \nGreensboro‚ÄìCharlotte (P Line) 0% 0% 0% 70% 19% 0% 11% 0% 100% \nCorridor Totals 1% 2% 1% 47% 18% 15% 15% 1% 100% \n \n \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n \n \n5-17\nTable 5-5: Contemplated Disposition of Private Grade Crossings \n(Expressed as Percentages of Total Crossings Studied by Segment) \nEliminate Retain Existing \nSegment  Close Separate \nRelocate \nRailroad \nUpgrade \nProtection\nKeep \nas-is \nRestore \nand \nupgrade \nExpand \nor move, \nwith \nupgrade \nAdd and \nprotect\nTotals by \nSegment \nRichmond‚ÄìCentralia  \n(Active S Line) 0% 0% 0% 0% 100% 0% 0% 0% 100% \nCentralia‚ÄìPetersburg‚ÄìNorlina \n (Restored S Line) (See footnote 29.) 50% 0% 0% 50% 0% 0% 0% 0% 100% \nNorlina‚ÄìRaleigh  \n(Active S Line) 76% 0% 0% 0% 24% 0% 0% 0% 100% \nRaleigh‚Äì Greensboro (H Line) 67% 0% 0% 0% 33% 0% 0% 0% 100% \nGreensboro‚ÄìCharlotte (P Line) 86% 0% 0% 0% 5% 0% 0% 10% 100% \nCorridor Totals 70% 0% 0% 11% 17% 0% 0% 2% 100% \n \nUpon completion of the program posited in Table 5-4 and Table 5-5, the inventory \nof highway-rail crossings between Richmond and Charlotte would be as shown in  \nTable 5-6. \nTable 5-6: Inventory of Highway-Rail Grade Crossings in Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor \nUpon Completion of the Contemplated Improvements \n \nSegment Line Miles\nNumber of \nPublic \nCrossings\nPublic \nCrossings \nper Mile \nNumber of \nPrivate \nCrossings \nPrivate \nCrossings \nper Mile \nTotal \nCrossings\nTotal \nCrossings \nper Mile \nRichmond‚ÄìCentralia  Now-Active S 10.7 9 0.8 1 0.1 10 0.9 \nCentralia‚ÄìPetersburg‚Äì\nNorlina29\nNow-\nAban-\ndoned S \n87.5 57 0.7 10 0.1 67 0.8 \nNorlina‚ÄìRaleigh Now-Active S 59.2 69 1.2 8 0.1 77 1.3 \nRaleigh‚Äì Greensboro H 80.6 106 1.3 7 0.1 113 1.4 \nGreensboro‚ÄìCharlotte P 100.4 107 1.1 3 0.0 110 1.1 \nCorridor Totals  338.4 348 1.0 29 0.1 377 1.1 \n \nSite-specific grade crossing analyses were outside the scope of this study; they \nwould be addressed in more detailed engineering work prior to construction. \n \n                                                 \n29 All inventories and projections for the now-abandoned portion of the S Line are based on limited field \ninvestigations of crossings that existed when the line was in service.

The improvements appear \nin their natural geographic sequence, \nfrom Richmond south to Charlotte.  \nWith respect to direction, the S Line \n(Richmond‚ÄìRaleigh) and the P Line \n(Greensboro‚ÄìCharlotte) are treated as \nrunning from north to south; the H \nLine (Raleigh‚ÄìGreensboro) is \nconsidered as running east to west.  \nFigure 6-1: The Richmond Area \nRichmond‚ÄìRaleigh  \n(S Line‚éØRuns North and \nSouth) \nThe use of the S Line is a \nplanning assumption subject to the \nenvironmental process, the current \nstatus of which is described in Chapter \n1. \nOverview of Train Operations \nthrough Richmond \nPassenger trains en route to or \nfrom south of Richmond currently use \nthe former Atlantic Coast Line \nRailroad (now the CSXT A Line) \nfrom Staples Mill Road Station, \nthrough Acca Yard, crossing the \nJames River to the west of downtown \nRichmond (see Figure 6-1). \nThe Bellwood Subdivision (part \nof the S line) currently extends from \nAcca Yard to Centralia, nine miles \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nsouth of Main Street Station, where it rejoins the CSXT A Line.  Restoration of passenger \nservice on the S Line would require its rehabilitation since it has not been a core system freight \nor passenger route for several decades.  The S line is, however, assuming an increased role in \nCSXT freight operations in the Richmond area, as a route for the westward movement of empty \ncoal trains from electric utilities in the Carolinas to the Piedmont Subdivision connection,1 \nabout one mile north of Main Street Station. \nVDRPT has initiated a study of the potential for re-instituting rail passenger service \nbetween Richmond and Norfolk. The passenger trains would utilize the Bellwood Subdivision \nto access Main Street Station, potentially adding to the complexity of rail operations between \nRichmond and Petersburg. \nRichmond‚ÄìCentralia \n(MP S ‚ÄúZero‚Äù‚ÄìS10.3; Track Charts 1 and 2)3\n \nThe simulations described in Chapter 4 show \nthat restoration of passenger train operations from \nStaples Mill Road Station through Main Street \nStation to Centralia would require construction of‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ Numerous improvements \nbetween Staples Mill Road \nStation and Main Street Station, \nas identified in the Washington to \nRichmond report;  \n‚Ä¢ Equipment storage and turning \nfacilities in close proximity to \nMain Street Station; and \n‚Ä¢ Track, signal, and interlocking \nimprovements between Main \nStreet Station and Centralia, so as \nto provide improved operating \nflexibility and capacity for \nreliable passenger and freight \noperations. \nRichmond: Main Street Station \nHigh-speed rail services proposed by the \nstates of Virginia and North Carolina would utilize Main Street Station, which the City of \nRichmond is in the process of upgrading as a multi-modal transportation center.

The interface of passenger and freight operations at the station, and in \nthe vicinity of the station, was previously analyzed.4  \n \nHistorically, Main Street Station was configured to serve the S Line of the SAL \n(running north-south) on the west side, and the C&O (running east-west to and from Newport \nNews) on the east side.5  However, a single track and platform on the west side of Main Street \nStation would be insufficient to reliably operate the volume of freight trains, through passenger \ntrains, and terminating/originating passenger trains projected for 2015. Two tracks and two \nplatforms would, therefore, be constructed on the west side of Main Street Station.  Thus, \nnorthward freight trains can be passing through the station on Track 2 while southward \npassenger trains and/or northward originating trains are loading/unloading in the station on \nTrack 1.  Similarly, northward and southward passenger trains may load/unload \nsimultaneously. \nRichmond‚ÄìCentralia \nThe simulations demonstrated that the existing track configuration between Richmond \nand Centralia would be inadequate to support the projected level of 2020 train operations.  \nImprovements \nImprovements in this segment would therefore include the following. \n‚Ä¢ Reconfiguration of Rocketts Interlocking to accommodate a proposed \nRichmond‚ÄìBristol rail passenger service; \n‚Ä¢ Relocation of the existing crossovers in the vicinity of MP S1.5 to \nDeepwater Junction (MP S1.8) to enable a progressive move, from north to \nsouth, to be made from the siding (Sixth Street lead) to Deepwater. The \nrelocation would facilitate the movement of the Acca-Deepwater turn from \nSouth Yard (located west of the railroad) to Deepwater (located east of the \nrailroad), Additional facilities would not be needed to permit moves made by \nthe local trains operating between Collier Yard (south of Petersburg) and the \nS Line. \n‚Ä¢ Replacement of the existing interlocking at Marlboro (S4.5) with a universal \ninterlocking (with two No. 20 crossovers to enable 45 mph passenger \nmoves6) at Dale (S4.8); and \n‚Ä¢ Relocation of the existing Falling Creek interlocking (S7.3), which is on a \ntwo-degree curve. The interlocking would be removed and a universal \ninterlocking (with two No. 20 crossovers) constructed north of MP S7 to \nreplace it.  The new interlocking would be located on the tangent track \n                                                 \n4 Potential Improvements to the Washington ‚Äì Richmond Railroad Corridor, Volume II, Appendix C. \n5 Ibid., Volume I, Main Report, p. 50. \n6 For a table of turnout/crossover numbers and their allowable speeds for diverging moves, see Chapter 4. \n 6-3\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nbetween the north end of the 2-degree curve, at MP S7.0, and the Falling \nCreek Bridge. \n‚Ä¢ Extension of the double track south of Rocketts from MP S8.9 to Centralia \n(approximately S10.7); \nFull reverse signaling would be installed as part of the overall signal system upgrade.   \nRationale \nThe single-track James River Bridge would be the most significant constraint between \nBrown Street (a proposed interlocking located north of Main Street Station) and Centralia. The \nuniversal interlockings at Dale and Falling Creek are essential to provide the operating \nflexibility and capacity to enable the train dispatcher to manipulate freight trains through the \navailable windows between Rocketts and Main Street, over the James River Bridge \nIt is assumed that passenger trains would have preference over freight trains for the use \nof the bridge.  Also, the numerous highway crossings between Dale and Rocketts cause a de \nfacto single-track operation for freight trains between Brown Street and Dale, even though two \ntracks actually exist on both sides of the James River Bridge.  Any train that must be held, must \nbe stopped clear of these crossings. Therefore: \n‚Ä¢ Northward freight trains would require sequencing to enable them to follow \na northward passenger train at Rocketts (located at the south end of the \nJames River bridge).  Northward freight trains would be held at Dale \nAvenue, just south of Dale Interlocking, to avoid blocking highway \ncrossings.  Freight trains would not be released from Dale Avenue unless \nthey could clear Main Street station before a southward passenger train was \nscheduled to depart Main Street Station.7  A northward freight train released \nfrom Dale Avenue must be assured non-stop access to the James River \nBridge. \n‚Ä¢ A southward freight train would not be released to enter Main Street Station \nif a northward freight train has been released from Dale Avenue. Stopping a \nfreight train between Dale and Rocketts would result in crossings being \nblocked, thereby delaying cross-street traffic. \nNorthward freight trains would be assumed to have absolute priority on the extended \nTrack 2 at Centralia, except in the following situation: \n‚Ä¢ A northward freight train passes Centralia less than 10 minutes before a \nnorthward passenger train; and \n‚Ä¢ A southward train (either freight or passenger) is occupying Track 1 between \nDale and Centralia. \nIf a passenger train proceeds northward from Centralia on Track 2, it could stop behind \na preceding northward freight train at Dale. This freight would be in a hold situation at Dale \nAvenue because it could not clear the James River Bridge ahead of the passenger train.  To \n                                                 \n7 Main St Interlocking, at the south end of the Station, is the north end of the single track on the bridge. \n 6-4\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\neliminate this possibility, the existing Falling Creek interlocking (S-7.3) would be removed and \na universal interlocking (with two No. 20 crossovers) constructed north of MP S7 to replace it. \nThe new interlocking would enable the passenger train to divert from Track 2 to Track 1 after \nthe southward train has passed the relocated Falling Creek Interlocking.  Once diverted to \nTrack 1, the northward passenger train could pass the preceding freight train being held on \nTrack 2, at Dale Interlocking.  The passenger train would continue northward to Rocketts on \nTrack 2 without stopping or diverting, if a northward freight train were not ahead of it between \nCentralia and Dale. \nNorthward passenger trains on Track 1 would proceed directly to Main Street Station \nwhen Track 2 between Centralia and Dale is occupied by freight trains. They would cross over \nto Track 2 at Dale only when necessary to overtake (pass) or meet a train between Rocketts and \nDale on Track 1.  \nCentralia‚ÄìPetersburg‚ÄîBurgess \n(MP S10.3‚ÄìS30; Figure 6-3; Track Charts 2 and 3) \nSouthward from Richmond, today‚Äôs active S Line ends at Centralia.  At least three \noptions exist for routing the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor through the Petersburg area: the \nroute ‚Äúas simulated‚Äù for this study, the Dunlop option, and the Battersea option.  The route ‚Äúas \nsimulated‚Äù and the Battersea option would locate the S Line parallel to the A Line just north of \nPetersburg8 and would continue to use the current Petersburg station at Ettrick; under the \nDunlop option, trains would stop in downtown Petersburg. All three alternatives appear in \nFigure 6-3. Although each option receives treatment below, more details are now available for \nthe option ‚Äúas simulated‚Äù than for the others. As indicated in Chapter 2, the alternative routes \nthrough the Petersburg area (including additional routing options9) are under study by Virginia \nas part of the Richmond to South Hampton Roads High-Speed Rail Feasibility Study.   \nOption ‚ÄúAs Simulated‚Äù  \n(Track Charts 2 and 310) \nOver the 20 miles between Centralia and Burgess, the option simulated in this study \nwould follow the former S Line routing for portions totaling 16 miles, but would diverge to \nparallel the A Line for some four miles in the vicinity of the Ettrick station. \nThe restoration of the S Line to Norlina (S98.2) would begin at Centralia (S10.6). A \nuniversal interlocking would provide full connectivity between the A Line and the S Line, in \nboth directions. About ten north/south CSXT freight trains and three passenger round trips to \nand from Florida (via the A Line and Charleston, South Carolina) would use the Centralia \ninterlocking to switch between the S and A Lines. One Florida passenger train (via Columbia, \nSouth Carolina) and the four Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte high-speed trains would operate between \nRichmond and Raleigh on the restored S Line. Because of a clearance limitation just south of \n                                                 \n8 The S Line formerly had an alignment through downtown Petersburg, east of the A Line; see the discussion \nbelow. \n9 For example, one alternative would route all Richmond‚ÄìRaleigh passenger trains from Centralia to Collier Yard \nvia the A Line, and then from Collier to Burgess via the Burgess Connection. \n10 The track charts do not depict either of the other options. \n 6-5\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nMain Street, the Auto Train would continue to operate on the A Line between Centralia and \nAcca Yard in Richmond.11\nFigure 6-3: Routing Options, Centralia‚ÄìPetersburg‚ÄìBurgess Area \n[Track Charts 2 and 3]  \n \n                                                 \n11 This would make no difference to the passenger service in the Richmond area, as the Auto Train makes no \nrevenue stops between Lorton (Northern Virginia) and Sanford, Florida. \n 6-6\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \nThe restored S Line would parallel the A Line south of Centralia for about two miles.  \nBetween mileposts S11 and S13, ‚ÄúChester‚Äù Siding would be provided to enable northbound \nfreight trains‚éØdiverging at Centralia from the restored S Line to the A Line, and vice-\nversa‚éØto wait clear of both lines, if access to the A Line is not immediately available. \nThe S Line would bridge over the A Line at MP S12.512. South of MP S12.5 the \nrestored S Line would be on the roadbed of the abandoned S Line to about MP S20. Between \nmileposts S16.4 and S20.2 a new ‚ÄúLynch‚Äù siding, much longer than the former siding at that \nlocation, would be constructed.  \nStarting at MP S20, rather than passing under the A Line as was the case with the \nabandoned S Line, the restored S Line would run parallel to the A Line through Petersburg. 13 \nThe parallel lines would serve a single passenger station in the Petersburg area‚éØat Ettrick, the \npresent location.  A universal interlocking (‚ÄúPete,‚Äù MP S20.7) would interconnect the A Line \nand the S Line one mile north of the passenger station. Pete Interlocking would‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ Enable passenger trains to operate on \neither the A Line or the S Line between \nCentralia and Pete; \nFigure 2-1: Assumed Station  \nat Petersburg (Ettrick) \n \n‚Ä¢ Enable freight trains that operate on the S \nline to enter or leave the A Line at Pete; \nand \n‚Ä¢ Make the CSXT a triple-track rail line \nbetween Centralia and Pete, thus adding \nsignificant capacity for both freight and \npassenger services. \n \nThe present Petersburg station has one platform, on \nthe northbound A Line track. The construction of a new S \nLine track on the west side of the existing tracks through the \nstation would necessitate a second platform, adjacent to the S \nLine track. \nAt about MP S23, the A Line and the restored S Line \nwould separate.  The A Line curves onto its 60-foot high \n1300-foot long single-track bridge over the Appomattox \nRiver. A new bridge, about one-half mile upstream from the \nA Line Bridge, would enable the restored S Line to cross the \nAppomattox and rejoin the former line on the south side of \n                                                 \n12 The S Line previously had crossed over the A Line at this location. \n13 The S Line crossed the Appomattox River on a major bridge that has been removed, and then passed under the \nA Line again just south of the present A Line Appomattox River Bridge. \n 6-7\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nthe river, at new MP S23.5. Since the milepost of the former line at that spot was MP S24.05,14 \nparalleling the A Line through Petersburg would produce an alignment about one-half mile \nshorter than that of the former SAL. \nA road accessing the Chaparral Steel plant at Secoast (MP S26.5), where the NS Belt \nLine15 passes over the former S Line, has been constructed on the alignment of the former S \nLine for a short distance. Restoration of the S Line requires either that the road be relocated or \nthat a new S Line alignment be constructed west of the former line; the former solution was \nassumed.  No changes to the existing NS Belt Line bridge are contemplated. \nThe alignment continues southward through Burgess (MP S30), where a connection to \nCollier Yard, on the A Line, formerly diverged but was removed when the S Line was \nabandoned. The connection was not needed for passenger or freight train operations under the \nPetersburg routing assumed for this analysis.  If the high-speed trains ultimately use other \nroutes through Petersburg, however (as described below), the Burgess Connection might be \nconsidered for restoration.    \nDunlop Option (Via A Line, Norfolk Southern, Downtown Petersburg) \nA third main track would be constructed on the east side of the A Line between \nCentralia and ‚ÄúDunlop,‚Äù continuing through Colonial Heights on the original ACL main line to \ndowntown Petersburg, at the former Norfolk &Western station.  There the track would split to \nconnect to the NS Norfolk District main line in both directions.  The eastward connection \nwould be for trains operating between Richmond and Norfolk, and the westward connection \nwould be for trains operating between Richmond and both Raleigh, NC and Rocky Mount, NC.  \nWest of downtown Petersburg there would first be a connection to the A Line, for trains to \nRocky Mount, then a connection to the S Line, for trains to Raleigh.   \nConcurrent with either the Dunlop or the Battersea option, and depending on the \nprojected CSXT freight traffic flows through Petersburg, the Burgess Connection might be \nrestored between Collier Yard on the A Line, and Burgess on the S Line.  This would permit \nfreight trains running to and from Raleigh to avoid the more pronounced grades and curves \nnecessary in the Dunlop and Battersea options.  It would also allow them to work at Collier, if \ndesired, and be held there, if necessary.   \nBattersea Option (Via A Line and Existing Station) \n A third main track would be constructed on the east side of the A Line, between \nCentralia and a point south of the existing Petersburg Station, at Ettrick.  There the third track \nwould diverge from the A Line, cross the Appomattox River on a new bridge, and split into \nconnections to the east and west on the NS Norfolk District main line.  Trains running between \nRichmond and Norfolk would pass by the former N&W station, and could stop there, if desired.  \nTrains running to Raleigh would turn westward, operate over the NS for a short distance, pass \n                                                 \n14 References to the S Line mileposts south of Petersburg will conform to the original mileposts. \n15 A portion of the NS route to/from Norfolk that bypasses Petersburg.  The track chart (No. 3) shows that a \nconnection between the S Line and the NS Belt Line to and from Norfolk could potentially be located in the \nvicinity of MP S26.  The whole issue of alternatives for direct rail passenger access to Norfolk is the subject of a \nseparate study by the VDRPT. \n 6-8\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nunder the A Line, and then diverge over a new connection16 to the S Line.  Trains running to \nRocky Mount would continue southward from Ettrick on the A Line, in the same manner as \nthey do today.  As in the Dunlop option, the Battersea option might require the Burgess \nConnection to be restored for freight purposes. \nBurgess‚ÄìNorlina \n(MP S30‚ÄìS98.3; Track Charts 3-8) \nThis portion of the S Line once supported top speeds of 79 mph for passenger trains and \n50 mph for freight trains but has numerous three and four-degree curves, which would (unless \nmodified) greatly constrain future train speeds. The Silver Meteor, the SAL‚Äôs fastest train \nbetween the Northeast and Florida, was scheduled in 1958 at one hour, 32 minutes between \nMain Street Station, Richmond, and Norlina; between those same points, the travel time for the \nRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte high-speed trains is projected to be one hour, 15 minutes. This one-fifth \nreduction in travel time would be achieved by increasing the top speed to 110 mph and by \nrelocating the line in several places where the current alignment would be unduly restrictive.  In \naddition, to assure capacity for reliable operations, five sidings would be provided. \nTable 6-1 describes the contemplated track additions and relocations between Burgess \nand Norlina: \nTable 6-1: Sidings and Relocations Contemplated Between Burgess and Norlina \nLoca-\ntion \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLoca-\ntion \nMP Contemplated Relocations \nS29.6-\nS34.5 \nBurgess Siding.  There was a 1.8-mile \nsignaled siding within this location (MP \nS30.9‚ÄìS32.7). Therefore a significant \nportion of the new siding can be built on \nthe former siding roadbed. \n \n S37.1- S39 \nDinwiddie Relocation.  A 1.4-mile \nrealignment, requiring a large fill, would \neliminate two four-degree curves and \nreduce a three-degree curve to one-\ndegree. Simulations of this improvement \nindicate that top speed on the relocated \ntrack would increase from 65 mph to 110 \nmph. The relocated alignment would \nreduce running time almost one-half \nminute and shorten the route by \napproximately 0.18 miles. \nS41‚Äì\nS44.5 \nDeWitt Siding.  There was a short (1.4-mile) \nsignaled siding within this location (MP \nS41.2‚ÄìS42.6). Therefore a portion of the new \nsiding can be built on the former siding \nroadbed, albeit at the cost of spacing the De \nWitt siding about 7 miles from the Burgess \nSiding, or 3 miles less than the ideal 10 miles. \n \n                                                 \n16 That is, the same connection that the Dunlop Option would employ for the same purpose. \n 6-9\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nLoca-\ntion \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLoca-\ntion \nMP Contemplated Relocations \n \nS58.5-\nS60.1 \nRelocation.  Realignment of two curves in \nthis 1.6-mile segment, within the limits of the \ncontemplated Alberta Siding, would increase \nspeed to 90 mph and help to eliminate the 80 \nmph speed restriction that would exist along \nthe track segment between MP S45 and S61, \nif curve relocations and adjustments are not \nmade. Travel time savings would approach \n0.3 minute. \nS55.4‚Äì\nS61 \nAlberta Siding.   A signaled siding at \nWarfield began at MP S55.8 and extended to \nMP S57.3; a second non-signaled siding at \nAlberta began at MP S59.5 and extended to \nMP S61. The two former sidings would be \nconnected into the 5.6 mile long Alberta \nsiding, which would have crossovers near its \nmidpoint (at Warfield), thus providing \noperating flexibility. \n  \nS62.6\n‚ÄìS65.9 \nRelocation.  A 2.4-mile relocation would \neliminate or reduce the curvature of six of the \nseven existing curves in the segment. The \nseventh curve would be reduced from three to \ntwo degrees by shifting the curve less than 25 \nfeet inward. The realignment would cross two \nridges, separated by a deep ravine. The former \nS-Line crossed the ravine and Great Creek on \na 411-foot long, approximately 50 feet high \ndeck plate girder bridge. It is assumed, for \nstudy purposes, that the ravine would be filled \nto eliminate the need for the Great Creek \nBridge. Speed on the relocated track would \nincrease to 90 mph, from the 65-75 mph that \nwould be possible if the curves are merely \nadjusted. Travel time savings would approach \n0.75 minute. \n \nS68.5-\nS75.3 \nRelocation.  The 7.1-mile curve realignment \nand right-of-way relocation would incorporate \nthe 3.7-mile Skelton Siding. Contemplated \nimprovements would: \n‚Ä¢ Reduce the curvature of four curves north \nof the Meherrin River Bridge; \n‚Ä¢ Replace three curves south of the \nMeherrin River Bridge (MP S70.2) with \none 1.6-degree right hand curve \nsupporting speeds up to 100 mph; \n‚Ä¢ Construct a 7,900-foot line change south \nof MP S71 to replace four curves with a \npair of reverse 1.75-degree curves to \nshorten the existing alignment by \napproximately 400 feet; \n‚Ä¢ Construct a 2900-foot relocation to replace \ntwo curves at the south end of the siding \n \n 6-10\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nLoca-\ntion \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLoca-\ntion \nMP Contemplated Relocations \nS71.2-\nS74.9 \nSkelton Siding (MP S71.2‚ÄìS74.9).  A mile-\nlong non-signaled passing siding at Skelton \nwas located between MP S73 and MP S74. \nSince this is difficult terrain, lengthening the \nsiding to four miles would be difficult.  \nHowever, in the absence of a better location, a \nnew siding would be constructed from \napproximately MP S71.2 to the north end of \nthe 271-foot, deck plate girder, Taylor Creek \nBridge, at MP S74.9. The contemplated 7.1-\nmile curve realignment and right-of-way \nrelocation would incorporate the siding. \n \n with a single 1.5-degree curve; the \nrelocation would provide sufficient room \nto place the turnout to the south end of the \nsiding on a tangent north of the Taylor \nCreek Bridge; and \n‚Ä¢ Reduce the curvature of Curve 75 from \ntwo degrees 20 minutes to one-degree 30 \nminutes by shifting the curve inward. \nThese changes would cut travel times by 1.4 \nminutes. \n S77-S77.8 \nRelocation. A 4,600-foot realignment would \nreplace three short three-degree reverse curves \n(75 mph) with one left-hand one-degree curve \n(110 mph) and eliminate a reduced speed zone \nin an otherwise high-speed stretch. The \nalignment avoids encroaching upon a \ncemetery adjacent to the right-of-way. The \nrevised alignment would reduce transit time \nalmost 0.5 minutes. \n \nS83-\nS87.2 \nBracey Siding.  The north end of the Bracey \nSiding would be located less than the \ndesirable 10-11 miles south of Skelton Siding. \nRather than eliminate the siding or have \nspacing greater than 10 miles, the study team \nretained the capacity that the siding would \nprovide. The roadbed of the northern end of \nthe former Hagood signaled siding, which \nextended from MP S83 to MP S84.5, would \nbe reused. The siding would extend to MP \nS87.2, and would subsume a 4,200-foot \ncontemplated relocation. \nS86.1-\nS87 \nRelocation.  A 4,200-foot relocation would \nreplace three curves (a left-hand 4.5-degree \ncurve (60 mph), a right-hand 4-degree curve \n(65 mph), and a left-hand 4-degree curve (65 \nmph)) with one two-degree curve (90 mph, \nwith five inches‚Äô superelevation). The \nrelocation would enable Bracey Siding to \nextend from MP S83 to S87.2.

One 2.5-degree, and two 3-\ndegree, curves south of the Roanoke River \nBridge would be realigned to reduce curvature \nto 1.5 degrees (110 mph). These realignments \nwould extend a stretch where trains can \noperate at a constant 110 mph, three miles \nfurther north and create the longest continuous \nhigh-speed stretch (20 miles, Bracey (MP \nS88.0) and MP S108.2) between Richmond \nand Raleigh. The revised alignment would \nreduce transit time almost 0.2 minutes. \n \nNorlina \n(Track Chart 8) \nThe route from Portsmouth, Virginia to Raleigh, North Carolina ‚éØconstructed before \nthe route from Richmond to Norlina‚éØwas the direct route through Norlina. The S Line from \nRichmond connected to the original line with a 5 plus-degree curve at Norlina Station. A 3-\ndegree curve was located one and a half miles north of Norlina at MP S96.5.  \nTo make the S Line the optimal route through Norlina, a 1.6-mile relocation (MP \nS96.5‚ÄìS98.7) would create a 7,000-foot long one-degree curve (110 mph) connecting the S \nLine and the Portsmouth Line.  The new alignment would necessitate a grade separation and \nwould make use of a reconstructed portion (3500 feet long) of the former line to Portsmouth. \nBy eliminating the highly restrictive (60 mph) five- and three-degree curves at Norlina, the \nrevised alignment would reduce transit time almost 0.9 minutes and would form part of the \nlongest (20-mile) continuous high-speed segment between Richmond and Raleigh \nThe north end of the Norlina Siding would be at the south end of the one-degree curve.  \nNorlina‚ÄìRaleigh \n(MP S98.3‚ÄìS157.4; Track Charts 8‚Äì12) \nBetween Norlina and Raleigh, CSXT has maintained the S line for light-density freight \nservice.  When this 58-mile section functioned as a main line, its top speeds were 79 mph for \npassenger trains and 50 mph for freight trains.  The contemplated improvements include \nsidings, curve realignments, and a station at Henderson, North Carolina. \nNorlina‚ÄìHenderson \nTable 6-2 shows the contemplated changes between Norlina and Henderson: \n 6-12\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nTable 6-2: Track Additions and Relocations Contemplated Between Norlina and Henderson \nLoca-\ntion \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLoca-\ntion \nMP Contemplated Relocations \nS98.2‚Äì\nS102.0 \nNorlina Siding.  The S Line previously was \ndouble tracked through Norlina, beginning \nat S97.8 and ending at MP S103.6. A new \nNorlina Siding would be constructed: its \nnortherly portion would form part of the \nNorlina relocation, while the balance would \nreuse the former second track roadbed. \n \n S102.5‚ÄìS104.8 \nManson Curve Relocation.  Between MP \nS102.5 and S104.8 currently lie three curves, \nof which the central ‚ÄúManson‚Äù curve exceeds \nthree degrees and would restrict speeds to 75 \nmph.  This relocation would ease the outer \ncurves in this cluster, eliminate Manson \nCurve entirely, shorten the route by 1,000 \nfeet, allow 110 mph speeds over the full 20 \nmiles between MP S88.0 and S108.2, and \nsave at least one-half minute in travel time. \nS108.9‚Äì\nS111.3 \nGreystone Siding.  From a spacing \nstandpoint, the next siding south of Norlina \nshould begin at MP S112.5, where a \nsignaled siding previously was located. \nHowever, that location would place a new \nsiding in Henderson, which has numerous \nhighway crossings that would be blocked by \na standing train.  Instead, the existing non-\nsignaled Greystone Siding (at MP S109.5‚Äì\nS110.5) would be extended to become a 2.4-\nmile siding between MP S108.9 and S111.3.  \nWithin the limits of the siding would be a \ncrossing at Greystone Road and a private \ncrossing. \n \n  \nHenderson Station \nPassenger service to Henderson ceased when Amtrak discontinued limited service on \nthe S Line in the late 1980s. Restoration of passenger service would require construction of \nstation and platform facilities. A single platform, planned for the east side of the right-of-way, \nwould suffice at this location.  The existing siding at Henderson, now used by the local freight \ntrain to serve the many industries there, would continue to be used for freight purposes; any \nnecessary meets could occur at the nearby Greystone or Kittrell sidings. \nHenderson‚ÄìRaleigh \nTable 6-3 lists the sidings contemplated between Henderson and Raleigh.  The \nnumerous curves south of Wake Forest17 present particular operational and engineering \ndifficulties and are evaluated below as a group. \n                                                 \n17 Note that the community of Wake Forest that is situated on the S Line is not the site of Wake Forest University, \nwhich is in Winston-Salem. \n 6-13\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nTable 6-3: Track Additions Contemplated Between Henderson and Raleigh \nLocation \nMP Track Addition \nS120‚Äì\nS123.7 \nKittrell Siding. Now abandoned, the formerly-signaled siding at Kittrell (MP S121.9‚Äì S123.5) \nwould be reinstalled and extended in both directions. The siding would enable CSXT local freight \ntrain F735 to work clear of the main track at Gill. \nS133.7‚Äì\nS138.0 \nYoungville Siding.  The abandoned, once-signaled siding at Franklinton (MP S129‚ÄìS130.5) is \nonly 5.3 miles south of Kittrell and would not be reinstalled. Instead, an active, non-signaled \nsiding at Youngsville (MP S135.3 to MP 136.6) would be upgraded as the next siding location \nsouth of Kittrell.  \nS147.6‚Äì\nS153.9 \nNeuse Siding.  The north end of a former double-track segment, now removed, was at Neuse (MP \nS147.6). The double track extended for over six miles to MP S153.9 at Crabtree. It is \ncontemplated that this double track would be rebuilt. \nS155.2‚Äì\nS157.1 \nEdgeton to Southern Junction.  The single track between Crabtree and Edgeton on the S Line \nnorth of Raleigh Yard would remain because a major bridge over Crabtree Creek can \naccommodate only a single-track. However, approximately two miles of double track would be \nrestored, between a point south of the Edgeton curve (at MP S155.2)) and Southern Junction (MP \nS157.1). The restoration of this double-track would be essential to provide for efficient train \nmovements throughout Raleigh. \nSeventeen curves, of as much as 3.25 degrees, currently complicate the segment from \nWake Forest southward, between mileposts 140 and 147.5.  So close together as to obviate the \ninstallation of proper spirals, these curves restricted former passenger trains to 60 mph. Two \noptions for dealing with the curves south of Wake Forest were evaluated: \n‚Ä¢ Modify individual curves; this option would raise top speeds to 75 mph and \nsave 1.2 minutes in travel time from the current alignment‚Äôs capabilities; or \n‚Ä¢ Treat these curves as a group, thus raising top speeds to 100 or 110 mph. and \nsaving 2.6 minutes over the current alignment‚Äôs capabilities. \nThis study assumed the latter option, which would include the following main work \nitems: \n‚Ä¢ Closing Dunn Street crossing in Wake Forest to enable Curve 140.1 to be \nsuperelevated to increase passenger train speeds to 110-mph from 70 mph; \n‚Ä¢ Extending and relocating Curve 141 approximately 39 feet northward, to \nreduce the curve to 1.5-degrees; \n‚Ä¢ Grade-separating or relocating the Forestville Road crossing18; \n‚Ä¢ Eliminating curves 142, 142.1, and 142.2, and constructing new tangent \ntrack extending to Curve 143; \n‚Ä¢ Reducing Curve 143 to 1.5 degrees, by moving it about 100 feet inward; \n‚Ä¢ Providing fill along a hillside to reduce Curve 143.1 to 1.5 degrees, and \nincrease speed from 60 mph to 110 mph; \n                                                 \n18 As this monograph goes to press, NCDOT reports that this crossing has, in fact, been relocated. \n 6-14\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Realigning Curves 144 and 144.1 to reduce radius from 2-degrees to 1.5 \ndegrees, and achieve a 110 mph operating speed.

This would achieve a 100-mph operating speed. \nA 200-foot tangent would separate the curves. \nRaleigh \n(MP S54.6‚ÄìH79; Track Charts 12-13)  \nRaleigh (set in its regional context in Figure 6-4) would be one of the most complex \ndispatching locations in the route between Richmond and Charlotte.  A revised configuration to \nsupport the contemplated operation was developed. \nFigure 6-4: Overview of Rail Lines in Raleigh Vicinity \n 6-15\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n Raleigh Station \n \nAmtrak currently uses \nthe Raleigh station of the \nformer Southern Railway \nCompany (SR), built in 1950.  \nIt is located on the H Line to \nSelma, just east of Boylan \nInterlocking.  The SR \ndiscontinued passenger \nservice to Raleigh in 1964. \nPassenger train service to the \nSR station resumed in 1984 \nwhen Amtrak moved from \nthe old Raleigh SAL station \nupon the abandonment of the \nS Line and the substitution of \na route via Rocky Mount, \nSelma, the eastern portion of \nthe H Line, and Raleigh. The \nstation currently accommodates three passenger train round trips daily: the Carolinian, \nPiedmont and Silver Star. \nFigure 6-5: Existing and New Raleigh Station Locations \n \nSource: NCDOT, http://www.bytrain.org/passenger/maps/raleighmap.html \nAs the current station is not on the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor under the S Line \nrouting assumption, it would require relocation.  In any event, the NCDOT has stated that a \nnew station is needed to accommodate current passengers and prepare for improved and \nexpanded train service in the years to come. In 1995, a report identified, as a suitable location \nfor a new and larger multimodal center, a site west of Boylan Interlocking on the H Line that \nwould allow all existing and projected intercity and commuter trains to use a single facility. \nRecent studies completed by NCDOT have determined that a new station could accommodate \nover 500,000 passengers annually by 2015. Conceptual planning for the multi-modal center is \nunderway; the planning phase is being funded jointly and equally by NCDOT, the City of \nRaleigh and the Triangle Transit Authority.19  \nThe present study envisions that a low-level, 24-foot wide center-island platform would \nbe located between Tracks 2 and 4,20 with a side platform to adjoin Track 1.  Normally, \npassenger trains would make use of Tracks 1 and 2, but the new Track 4 (destined mainly for \n                                                 \n19 This background information on the existing and proposed Raleigh stations comes from NCDOT at \nhttp://www.bytrain.org/passenger/stationimp/iraleigh.html. \n20 Track numbers are based on the track charts in Appendix D, and are also used in the relevant figures. These \nnumbers are often hypothetical: in many cases the tracks referred to neither exist nor have ever existed, so that the \nrailroad has never had occasion to number them. \n 6-16\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nfreight trains) would afford additional flexibility. The simulation revealed that the platform \nconfiguration and the adjacent interlocking (south of the station‚éØsee page 6-22) would have \nimportant capacity benefits. \nThe station would be a multi-modal terminal serving local bus, TTA, long-distance bus, \ntaxi, and auto, in addition to intercity trains. \nOverview of Operation \nThe complexity of railway traffic in Raleigh stems from the multiplicity of flows and \ntypes of operations to be served, as illustrated in Table 6-4 \nTable 6-4: Train Movements Through Raleigh \nTo and From the North and East To and From the South and West \n1. NS freight trains to and from Glenwood \nYard; \n1. NS freight trains to and from Linwood Yard \nand the P Line; \n2. CSXT freight trains to and from Raleigh \nYard; \n2. CSXT freight trains to and from Cary, Apex, \nColumbia; \n3. NS freight trains to and from the H Line \ntoward Selma21; 3. NS freight trains to and from Varina; \n4. CSXT freight trains to and from north of \nRaleigh on the S Line; \n4. Intercity passenger trains to and from \nGreensboro and Charlotte; and \n5. Intercity passenger trains to and from \nRichmond on the S Line; and \n6. Intercity passenger trains to and from the \nNCDOT Yard adjacent to the CSXT Yard at \nRaleigh. \n5. Intercity passenger trains to and from Cary, \nApex, Columbia \n \nContemplated CSXT Operations Through Raleigh22\nLocal Freight Trains \nCSXT would operate two local freight trains per day north of Raleigh, on the S Line, \noriginating at Raleigh Yard. The exact operating limits of the trains would vary somewhat from \nday to day, depending upon the workload. The first train would operate north of Wake Forest to \nNorlina, while the second train would turn at about Wake Forest and continue south of Raleigh, \nworking through Fetner to Apex on the CSXT Line, before returning to Raleigh Yard. As \ninitially simulated for this study, the second local freight train received a large number of \nsignificant delays because of conflicts with daylight passenger and freight trains.  Therefore, it \nwas rescheduled to leave Raleigh at 1:00 a.m., when passenger trains would not be operating. \n                                                 \n21 Also any residual intercity passenger trains making use of the route via Selma; none of these are assumed to \nremain in this analysis.   \n22 Details of the assumed 2020 NS and CSXT freight trains are presented in Appendix F. \n 6-17\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nThrough Freight Trains \nA freight train would depart Raleigh Yard southbound for Hamlet, North Carolina with \ncars from the two local trains, and would return northbound to Raleigh Yard from Hamlet with \ncars for that day‚Äôs local trains.  This train would also provide local service between Cary and \nHamlet. \nCSXT has proposed that four northbound and four southbound intermodal trains would \noperate between Fetner and Centralia. In the simulations, these trains were assumed to operate \nuniformly during the day. The trains would randomly enter the corridor between the time \nscheduled and two hours later. These trains would not work at Raleigh.   \nA northbound and a southbound merchandise train23 with traffic to and from Richmond \nand points north would operate between Fetner and Centralia; these trains would work at \nRaleigh.   \nContemplated NS Operations at Raleigh \nLocal Freight Trains \nA local freight train (LCL6) works between Raleigh and Pomona Yard in Greensboro. \nThe train serves industries on the branch between Glenn (on the H Line at MP H46.8) and \nChapel Hill. In the initial simulations for this study, this train was scheduled to work during \ndaylight; with the large number of passenger trains, however, the local freight train could not \nreach Greensboro in less than twelve hours. 24 Therefore, its schedule was changed to a late \nevening start. Since nearly all the industrial sidings between Raleigh and Greensboro are \ntrailing going west,25 an eastward counterpart local freight has not been scheduled. A Spencer \nYard26-to-Raleigh through train was assumed to handle local service to the few trailing-switch \nsidings going east. \nThrough Freight Trains \nThree westbound27 and three eastbound NS through trains would operate daily between \nRaleigh and Greensboro, via the H Line.  Over the 7-day period of the simulation, all these \ntrains randomly entered the system between the time scheduled and two hours later. \n‚Ä¢ Westbound and eastbound trains (NSLI/LINS28) would operate through \nRaleigh between Spencer Yard and Chocowinity (located to the east of \nRaleigh and Wilson, on the original Norfolk Southern Railway29 line).  \n                                                 \n23 Designated ‚ÄúHAAC‚Äù and ‚ÄúACHA‚Äù‚éØHamlet/Acca Yard (Richmond) and vice versa \n24 Twelve hours is the maximum length of time that a single crew can work under the hours of service regulations. \n25 I.e., each siding joins the main line at the siding‚Äôs western end.  Since the locomotive is at the front of the train, \nthis arrangement makes a westbound train more efficient for local switching than an eastbound train. \n26 As described in Chapter 2, Spencer Yard is located in Linwood, North Carolina, approximately eight miles north \nof the Salisbury station. \n27 The westbound-only local freight brings the total number of southbound NS trains to four. \n28 These codes refer to the Proposed 2020 Schedules in Appendix F. \n29 The original Norfolk Southern Railway was a regional railroad serving eastern Southside Virginia and North \nCarolina. Its main line extended from Hampton Roads to Raleigh, and thence via its own route (different from the \nH Line) to Charlotte.  At Varina (south and west of Raleigh), a branch line left the main for Fayetteville, to the \nsouth.  The original Norfolk Southern Railway was purchased by the Southern Railway System on January 1, \n 6-18\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Westbound and eastbound trains (RAWS/WSRA) would operate between \nRaleigh (Glenwood Yard) and Roanoke, via Winton-Salem.  \n‚Ä¢ Westbound and eastbound freight trains (RALI/LIRA) would operate \nbetween Raleigh (Glenwood Yard) and Linwood (Spencer Yard).  \nAdditional trains may enter or leave Glenwood Yard, but only daily southbound and \nnorthbound freight trains (RAFA/FARA) that operate between Raleigh and Varina/Fayetteville \nover the original Norfolk Southern Railway were simulated. Each of these trains must cross the \nRichmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor at grade, without a significant impact on SEC train operations. \nAlso considered in the analysis, but not simulated, were occasional NS freight trains \nover the H line between Raleigh (Glenwood Yard) and Selma.   \nOperating Challenges and Contemplated Solutions \nThe challenge in Raleigh is not the frequency of trains, but the diversity of their origins \nand destinations, the potential for conflicting paths, and the need to anticipate conflicts and \nprovide adequate trackage to alleviate those conflicts‚Äô effects.  In particular, trains need \nefficient, accessible space where they can be held for higher-priority trains.  The following \nsections briefly identify the most serious operating challenges in Raleigh and illustrate the \ncontemplated resolutions.  Figure 6-6, a close-up map of Raleigh proper, and Figure 6-7 (a \ncondensed track chart showing the existing configuration and the contemplated improvements \nin Raleigh) provide background to this discussion. \n                                                                                                                                                           \nFigure 6-6: Close-Up of Raleigh \n[Track Layout Reflects ‚ÄúContemplated‚Äù Configuration in Figure 6-7] \n \n1974.  Subsequently, the Southern merged with the Norfolk & Western to form the current NS.

In turn, the turnout branching off to the CSXT yard from the joint lead track \nwould also be power-operated.  The substitution of electronic for manual operation would \nexpedite Raleigh‚ÄìCharlotte passenger train movements‚éØfive originations and five \nterminations per day‚éØas well as the CSXT yard moves.   \nChallenge: Single-Track Bottleneck at Boylan/Southern Junction Interlocking \nAt present, any train occupying the single-track section at reference point B essentially \nblocks all traffic in all directions in Raleigh. \nContemplated Resolution \nBoylan/Southern Junction would be reconstructed as a multiple-track, universal \ninterlocking with the following features and benefits: \n‚Ä¢ Double track would extend northward to reference point C (near Edgeton), \nallowing additional flexibility for trains to be held and to pass each other; \n‚Ä¢ Access between the NS Glenwood Yard and the former Norfolk Southern \nRailway south to Varina would be changed from a crossing at Boylan (Path \nE) to a progressive move across new crossovers and trackage  (Path E¬¥).  \nRemoval of the crossing at Path E would allow the rigid crossing frogs at \nBoylan Interlocking to be removed, thus enabling adequate spirals and \nsuperelevation to be installed in the ten-degree curve between Boylan and \nHargett Street.  As a result, speed over this ten-degree curve would increase \nfrom 10 to 30 mph on Tracks 1 and 2.   \n‚Ä¢ Also, NS freight moves to and from the Glenwood Yard would see a rise in \nMAS to 30 mph, since the track leading to the yard is signaled, and the No. \n15 turnouts would allow freight train speeds up to 30 mph.  \nChallenge: Additional Train Holding/Passing Space Needed South of Boylan \nEven with the Boylan/Southern Junction interlocking expanded, there would still be a \nneed to for trains to hold, or pass each other when feasible, south of reference point B in the \nevent that‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ One or two passenger trains are stopping at the new Raleigh Station (see \nbelow); \n‚Ä¢ A freight train is ready to depart the CSXT Yard or NS Glenwood Yard;  \n                                                 \n30 All reference points in the Raleigh discussion refer to Figure 6-7. \n 6-21\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Two southbound trains, of whatever type, are competing for a slot to leave \nRaleigh; and/or \n‚Ä¢ Southbound trains are occupying the single-track stretch north of Raleigh. \nThese are just examples; with so many potential paths involved, many eventualities will \ncall for additional flexibility and capacity in the Raleigh area. \nContemplated Resolution \nTrack capacity south from Boylan/Southern Junction would be expanded as follows: \n‚Ä¢ A new or rehabilitated third track would extend all the way from reference \npoint B to reference point F. \n‚Ä¢ A new, three-track Raleigh Station‚éØwith platforms serving all three \ntracks‚éØwould be built on the straight segment between Boylan and MP \nH80.  This site has the added advantage of lacking highway-railroad grade \ncrossings. \n‚Ä¢ A new universal interlocking, ‚ÄúAshe,‚Äù would be constructed at reference \npoint F. This interlocking would position and sequence northbound trains for \naccess to the station, the three yards, and the S Line toward Richmond.  In \neffect, Ashe Interlocking would convert the two parallel single-track \noperations of the CSXT and the NS between Fetner and Raleigh31 into a \nmore flexible, double-track operation‚éØto all carriers‚Äô benefit. \nAdditional Flexibility Proximate to Raleigh \nAlso immediately assisting the operation in Raleigh would be the provision of long \npassing sidings at three nearby locations: \n‚Ä¢ Between Neuse and Crabtree, north of Raleigh on the S Line (see page \n6-14)‚éØapproximately 6¬Ω miles long; \n‚Ä¢ Between Cary and South Cary, west of Raleigh on the H Line (less than \nthree miles long); and \n‚Ä¢ On the connecting CSXT line south to Hamlet and Columbia, a 3¬Ω-mile \nsiding beginning some 2¬Ω miles south of the junction with the H line at \nFetner (see Track Chart 14a and the description on page 6-24). \nProvided on each of the more important routes converging at Raleigh, these sidings \nwould greatly enhance the flexibility of train operations by allowing dispatchers to hold and \nsequence trains just outside the terminal zone.   \n                                                 \n31 At present, there is no interlocking between Fetner and Boylan‚éØa distinct handicap in this area of special \ncomplexity. \n 6-22\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nRaleigh‚ÄìGreensboro (H Line‚éØRuns East and West) \n(MP H80.6‚ÄìH ‚ÄúZero‚Äù; Track Charts 13‚Äì19) \nThe H Line between Raleigh and Greensboro would be upgraded to top speeds up to \n110 mph. Although passenger trains speeds would be increased throughout the line, numerous \nrestricted speed locations would remain. \nThe projected increase in intercity rail service, at increased operating speeds, would \nrequire additional track capacity between Raleigh and Greensboro for overtaking freight trains \nand meeting freight trains or other passenger trains. Almost 31 miles of siding-track (38 percent \nof the 81 route-miles), with appropriate interlocking modifications, would be constructed.  The \nchanges in track configuration would ease congestion, ensure dependability of the train \nschedules, offset capacity constraints, and accommodate the increased level of intercity \npassenger and freight movements. \nRaleigh‚ÄìFetner/Cary  \n(MP H80-6‚ÄìH64.0, also CSXT Aberdeen Subdivision; Track Charts 13, 14, 14a) \nThe conversion of the eight-mile segment between Raleigh and Fetner from what are \neffectively two single-track lines operated by CSXT and NS,32 to a double-track, high-capacity \nrailroad (see page 6-22) would also entail \nthe upgrading of both tracks for \nuniformly higher speeds.  Figure 6-8 \ndepicts additional site-specific projects \ncontemplated for the vicinity of this \nsegment; they are as follows:   \nFigure 6-8: Fetner/Cary Vicinity \n \nFetner Interlocking \nFetner Interlocking (MP H73) \nwould be reconfigured for more flexible \nand faster operation. Located on a curve \nat the junction of the H Line and the \nCSXT Aberdeen Subdivision, the \ninterlocking enables CSXT trains on the \nCSXT-owned track between Raleigh and \nFetner to access the Aberdeen \nSubdivision and NS trains on the H Line \ntrack to access the H Line west of Fetner.   \nTo facilitate these train movements, the interlocking would be moved to a 1000-foot \ntangent between the two curves at Fetner, and turnout sizes would be increased to Number 20.  \nAccordingly, maximum train speeds for diverging moves at this interlocking would rise from \ntoday‚Äôs 25 mph to 45 mph (passenger), and from 15 mph to 40 mph (freight). The interlocking \ncan be reconfigured independent of the work on the Fetner or Cary Sidings. \n                                                 \n32 This segment is, however, dispatched by CSXT from Jacksonville for both the CSXT and NS tracks. \n 6-23\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nFetner Siding on CSXT Aberdeen Subdivision \n(Track Chart 14a) \nTo keep operations fluid on the H Line and through Raleigh, a siding would be installed \njust south of Fetner on the CSXT Aberdeen Subdivision.  The siding would allow trains to and \nfrom the Aberdeen Subdivision to meet or pass. If, for example, an eastbound freight train is to \nmeet a westbound freight train at Fetner, the eastbound train can be held on the siding allowing \nthe westbound train to easily access the CSXT line, minimizing delays on the H Line.  The \nsiding would be located so that a freight train occupying the siding would not block any of the \ngrade crossings located just south of Cary Station. \nCary Station \nPresently served by two Amtrak round trips daily, Cary is assumed to receive intercity \npassenger service from ‚Äúlocal‚Äù Charlotte‚ÄìRaleigh high-speed trains, as detailed in Appendix F.  \nA single-track, single-platform station is envisioned at the present location‚éØbetween \nHenderson and Academy Streets at MP H72.6. \nCary Siding (on H Line West of Cary Station) \nOperations west of Raleigh are complicated by a long 0.85 percent grade at Ashe \nInterlocking.  This grade would prevent southbound freight trains, originating in the Raleigh \nvicinity, from attaining their maximum allowable speed on the H Line for many miles.  Indeed, \ntrain performance calculator simulations indicate that heavy freight trains, close to their \nmaximum tonnage, would accelerate to only 14 to 15 mph (i.e., four minutes per mile) for the \nfirst four miles south of the yard track at Southern Junction.  Because of this poor performance, \n‚éØin the absence of a siding just south of Raleigh, ‚éØfreight trains would have to be held in the \nRaleigh yards for as much as an hour in anticipation of a passenger train‚Äôs arrival from \nRichmond, if delays to the passenger train are to be prevented.   \nTo avoid this need and to expedite freight traffic, a new, 3.6-mile passing siding would \nbe located on the H Line west of Fetner Interlocking and the Cary station, and would extend \nbetween MP H72.6 and Crabtree Creek at MP H69. To be used primarily by freight trains, the \nCary siding would provide a location for a slow-moving westward freight to be overtaken by a \npassenger train. The siding also would provide capacity to store an eastward freight train if the \nroute between Fetner and Raleigh becomes congested with CSXT and NS freight trains. Two \nhighway crossings, one public and one private, would be located within the limits of the siding. \nThe public crossing, Morrisville Boulevard, would have to be grade-separated because of \nsuperelevation in both the main track and the siding.33  \nCurve Realignment between Cary and Brassfield  \nBetween MP H65.1 and MP H64.4, an existing three-degree curve would be reduced to \n2.15 degrees, with the maximum allowable speed increasing from 70 mph to 90 mph. \n                                                 \n33 That is,‚éØas described in Chapter 5,‚éØwith banking in both the main and passing track, the highway surface \nwould have a ‚Äúdouble hump‚Äù at the crossing‚éØnot a recommended condition. \n 6-24\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nProjects in the Durham Vicinity \n(MP H64-H52) \nFigure 6-9: Durham \n \nThe route through Durham currently suffers from a difficult alignment, with numerous \ncurves of two degrees and more, as well as a lack of sufficient main line capacity parallel to a \nbusy yard.  In fact, a siding does not now exist to enable a freight train to set off or pick up at \nDurham Yard without blocking the main track of the H Line. This capability is needed to \nprotect reliable freight and passenger service. Thus, a coordinated program of improvements in \nthe Durham area is contemplated (see the schematic, Figure 6-9): \n‚Ä¢ A relocated, new main track would be provided on the southerly side of the \nexisting right-of-way, from a new Brassfield Interlocking (MP H60.3) \nthrough a reconstructed East Durham Interlocking (MP 54.6), and \neffectively continuing through to West Durham Interlocking.  In total, 3.7 \nmiles of new track would be reconstructed and eight curves relocated to \n 6-25\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\ncreate a 6.8 mile section of 110-mph operation between Mileposts H62.8 and \nH56.34,35   \n‚Ä¢ The new main track would be built with curves not exceeding 1.5 degrees, \nwith superelevation and spirals designed for 110 mph operation.  These \nimproved features are clearly shown in Figure 6-9 (note highlighted \nexamples of lower curvature and higher superelevation). \n‚Ä¢ The existing main track would be converted to a passing siding between \nBrassfield and East Durham; \n‚Ä¢ The existing siding at Durham Yard would be expanded to provide needed \ncapacity for freight trains to stand or work independently of passenger trains; \n‚Ä¢ The station would be relocated and redesigned.  In July 1996 the City of \nDurham and the NCDOT opened a new interim station downtown. The \nstation replaced a small bus-type shelter that served the City for six years. A \nnew multi-modal center is planned for Durham in the vicinity of the old \nLiggett & Myers Tobacco Company, near West Durham Interlocking. The \nsite is located alongside the longest section of track unbroken by city streets \nin downtown. The multi-modal center will be adjacent to several other \nhistoric buildings that are being refurbished for residential, entertainment \nand office use. A center-island platform will be provided to serve intercity \npassengers at MP H54.8; and \n‚Ä¢ Existing sidings would be expanded and joined between East and West \nDurham Interlockings, to enable passenger trains to meet at Durham.  \nAlthough this siding would have numerous highway crossings, it would be \nsuitable for passenger purposes and would enhance the flexibility of the line. \n                                                 \n34 The contemplated Triangle Transit Authority (TTA) rail commuter facility through this location is proposed to \ncross over from the west side to the east side of the NCRR right-of-way on an elevated structure. The final design \nof the high-speed rail improvements would need to be coordinated with the proposed TTA alignment to ensure that \na mutually beneficial set of improvements is achieved. \n35 Contemplated improvements for this 110-mph section also would include: lengthening the spirals of Curve \nH60.1 and relocating a left-hand industrial switch located on the low side of the curve; reconstructing Curve H60 \nas a 1.5-degree curve and grade-separating the Route 1654 crossing; reconstructing Curves H59.1 and H59 from 3 \ndegrees to 1- and 1.5 degrees, and eliminating Curve H59.2; and reconstructing Curves H58, H57, and H56, \nreducing these short 2-2-degree curves to 1.5 degrees.  The remaining four curves in the section would be \nrealigned for 85-mph train operation.  Recommended improvements include: Reducing Curve H55.3, a 3-degree \ncurve, to 2.5-degrees by shifting the track inward approximately 32 feet, onto the roadbed of former CSXT tracks; \nthe potential for closing, or grade separating the Fayetteville Street crossing, located in the west spiral of this curve \nshould be evaluated; extending the new east H55.3 spiral through Ramseur Street crossing; realigning Curves \nH55.2, H55.1, and H55 to a uniform 2.1 degrees; and closing Dillard Street, in the east portion of the curve, by \nconstructing a grade separation to avoid a highway crossing on a curve with six inches of superelevation. \nAlternatively, if the crossing were not grade separated, traffic could be channeled to the Roxboro Street underpass. \nThe curves are located within the limits of the proposed siding between East and West Durham Interlockings, but \ncould be constructed independent of the siding. \n 6-26\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nDurham‚ÄìGreensboro \n(MP H52‚ÄìH02; Track Charts 15-19) \nFunston‚ÄìGlenn Siding and Relocation \nAn important track doubling and curve realignment project is envisioned in the area \nbetween MP H 49.0 and H 43.1.  In this area, a second track would be built on a relocated \nalignment to serve as the new main track (see Figure 6-10); the old main track would serve as a \npassing siding. \nFigure 6-10: Funston‚ÄìGlenn Siding and Relocation \n \n 6-27\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nCombining the existing, shorter, Funston and Glenn sidings, a new 5.0-mile second \ntrack would be constructed with a mid-point interlocking‚éØNorth Glenn. Toward Funston there \nwould be a two-mile section that is free of highway crossings, hence able to hold long freight \ntrains without adversely affecting highway traffic. \nWith the existing main track to be converted to a siding, 11,000 feet of new main track \nwould be constructed to eliminate several restrictive curves. The new track would bridge over \nthe branch to Chapel Hill36 and would cut directly across Stony Creek valley on a 50-foot fill.  \nUniversity Station Road would continue to cross the existing track (i.e. the contemplated \npassing siding) at grade, but would grade separated over the new main track. The relocation \nwould end near the Highway 10 underpass, west of the current west end of Curve H44.1. \nApproximately 800 feet in distance would be saved.     \nDue to this project, the route would be straighter as well as shorter: a series of curves, \nranging between two and four degrees, would be adjusted to eliminate restrictive speeds.37 \nUpon completion of these adjustments, Curve H50‚éØa 2,935-foot, four-degree, 60-mph curve \nspanning four-lane SR 147‚éØwould be the most restrictive curve between Hillsborough (MP \nH40) and Raleigh (MP H80).   \nThe changes between MP H43.1 and MP H49.0 would create a 4.9-mile long segment \nthat can be operated at 100-110 mph. The reduction in distance traveled would reduce travel \ntime about 0.1 minutes. The increased speed on the remaining trackage would save an \nadditional 1.1 minutes. Thus, a travel time reduction of 1.2 minutes would be achieved. \nOther Capacity and Curve Changes \nThe sidings and curve realignments contemplated for the segment between MP H43.1 \n(South Glenn) and Greensboro appear in Table 6-5. \n                                                 \n36 There would be no connection between the new main track and the Chapel Hill branch. \n37 The curve adjustments would include:  \n‚Ä¢ Slightly modifying Curve H49, which reverses into Curve H50‚éØa long four-degree curve.  With less than 100 \nfeet between the spirals of Curves H49 and H50, and with Curve H50 not planned for major straightening, the \nTPC runs indicate that the maximum speed achievable through Curve H49 would be less than 80 mph.  \nTherefore, Curve H49 therefore, the curve would be merely adjusted, not relocated;  \n‚Ä¢ Realigning Curve H48.1, a 2-degree curve, to support 95 mph operations;  \n‚Ä¢ Shifting Curve H48, a 4-degree curve, inward 200 feet, to reduce curvature to two degrees and also remove a \n65 mph restriction;  \n‚Ä¢ Shifting Curve H47, a 3.3-degree curve, less than 35 feet, to achieve 1.75 degrees and 100 mph operation; \n‚Ä¢ Moving the industrial switch leading to Carolina Builders (MP H47.1) westward from the body of the curve to \nlocate it on tangent track;  \n‚Ä¢ Constructing a 2.1-mile (11,000-foot) segment of second-track (including Curves H46.1, H46, H45, and \nH44.1 to increase speed, facilitate lengthening of the Funston Siding, and provide access to Chapel Hill on the \nGlenn-Carrboro Branch; and  \n‚Ä¢ Realigning Curve H44, a short 2-degree curve to 1.75 degrees for 100 mph operation. \n 6-28\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nTable 6-5 : Track Additions and Relocations Contemplated Between South Glenn and \nGreensboro \nLocation \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLocation \nMP Contemplated Relocations \nH42.9‚Äì\nH41.8 \nCurve H42.1, a 3-degree curve, Curve H42, a 4-\ndegree curve, and Curve H41.1, a 3.5-degree curve, \nwould be realigned to increase speed to 75 mph.  \nThis would eliminate a restrictive 60 mph segment. \nThe realignment would include: \n‚Ä¢ Constructing a new bridge for Cates Run \n(currently 47 feet long) to adjust Curve \nH42.1; \n‚Ä¢ Adjusting the tangent between Curves \nH42 and H41.1 enabling the curvature of \nCurve H41.1 to be reduced from 3.5 \ndegrees to 3.15 degrees, and Curve H42 \nto be reduced from four degrees to three \ndegrees; and \n‚Ä¢ Relocating an industrial switch to \nGeorgia Pacific, located in the spiral of \nCurve H42, to the new tangent to \nimprove ride quality and reduce \nmaintenance costs. \n \nH38.9‚Äì\nH36.4 \nA 1.5-mile relocation would reduce two 3-degree \ncurves; Curves H37 and H38.2, each limited to 70 \nmph, to 1.75-degree curves.  In addition, Curves \nH38 and H38.1 would be eliminated. To be \nconstructed in conjunction with the Efland‚ÄìMebane \nSiding, the relocation would increase operating \nspeeds to 100 mph. The main track would be \nconstructed on the 100-mph alignment.  Southward \ntrains would likely save less time because of the \ngrade between Eno River and Efland. H37.5‚Äì\nH31.6 \nEfland‚ÄìMebane Siding.  The existing \nEfland siding should be extended southward \nto include the existing siding at Mebane.  A \ncurve realignment at Efland  (see columns to \nthe right) would allow the existing main track \nto become the new siding at that location. \nThe extension would result in a 5.9-mile long \nsiding between MP H37.5 and MP H31.6. \nThe long siding would enable a passenger \ntrain to meet one freight train and overtake \nanother freight train (see Chapter 4). A mid-\nsiding pair of crossovers would be provided \nto enable two opposing freight trains to \noccupy the siding at the same time. The north \nportion of the siding has a section of more \nthan two miles without a highway crossing. \n \n H29.2‚Äì H26.3 \nThe numerous curves in this section would be \ngrouped together and relocated.  The compound \ncurves H28.4, H28.3, and H28.2 would be \nrealigned to a maximum of 1.56 degrees, to achieve \na 105 mph operation. Curves H28.2 and H26.2 \nwould be relocated and connected, to eliminate \nrestrictions on the five intervening curves, thereby \nraising the speed limit from the current 60/70 mph \nto 105 mph. A new bridge spanning Back Creek \n(MP H27.6) would be constructed.  Curve H26.1 is \na 3-degree curve located immediately south of \nCurve H26.2, a 4-degree curve. These curves must \nbe considered together to achieve a 75-mph \nalignment. Curve H26.2 would be realigned; Curve \nH26.1 would be shifted 34 feet to achieve 75 mph. \nThe track would continue to pass under the State \nRoute 1928 overhead bridge.  Curve H26, a 579-\nfoot, 4-degree curve, would be shifted inward five \nfeet to create a 3-degree, 75-mph curve. \n 6-29\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nLocation \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLocation \nMP Contemplated Relocations \n \nH25.5‚Äì\nH21.5 \nHaw River Siding.  Haw River, a totally \nnew siding, would be located between MP \nH25.5 and MP H21.5. The siding would be \nwest of the bridge over the Haw River and \neast of the Burlington Station. \nApproximately a 2-mile section in the north \nportion of the siding and a 1.5-mile section at \nthe south end of the siding would be free of \ncrossings. As is the case with several other \nproject proposals on this single-track line, the \ncurrent main track would become the siding \nin this section. This would enable an \nindustrial switch to remain on the former \nmain track.38  This siding and its westerly \napproaches would be designed in conjunction \nwith the curve relocations between MPs \nH22.3 and 20.5, most of which is single-\ntrack. \n \nH22.3‚Äì\nH20.5 \n \nIn Burlington, Curves H21.2 and H21.1, and \nreverse Curves H21 and H20.2, appear to be the \nresult of cuts and throws when adjacent tracks were \nremoved. Lengthening both reverse curves would \nincrease operating speed to 100 mph or greater. A \n2700-foot section of new track would be \nconstructed parallel to the current main track and \nthe current main track would be retired to eliminate \nCurves H21.1 and H21.2. (The new track would \nextend southbound from Mebane Street to the north \nend of Curve H20.1.) The curve relocations would \nbe constructed in conjunction with the South \nBurlington end of the Haw River Siding. \nH11.8‚Äì\nH7.8 \nMcLeansville Siding.  An existing siding at \nMcLeansville should be extended northward \nto MP H11.8 and southward to MP H 7.8 to \ncreate a four-mile long siding. This siding \nwould have an interval of about 1.6 miles \nwhere a freight train can stand without \nblocking any highway crossings. \n \n H6.3‚ÄìH5.6 \nCurve H6, a right-hand 1-degree curve, presently is \nonly 44 feet from Curve H5.3, a right-hand 2.5-\ndegree curve. The curves would be realigned into \none continuous 1.58-degree curve to achieve 100 \nmph operation. A new bridge over Buffalo Creek \nwould be required as part of this realignment. .  \nCurves H5.2 and H5.1 form a compound curve of \n2.1 degrees on the east end and 1.8 degrees on the \nwest-end.39  They would be realigned to achieve a \ncontinuous 2-degree curve capable of 95 mph \noperation. \n                                                 \n38 The turnout to Cannon Mills, an active industry, comes off the high side of Curve H23.  Designating the existing \nmain track as a siding would enable the industrial switch to come off the siding with less superelevation than the \nmain track.  (Superelevation, while assisting high-speed through traffic, complicates freight switching operations.) \nThe need to facilitate rail freight access to active industries is an important consideration throughout the \nconceptual design of this corridor, which has much more on-line industry than other corridors addressed in this \nseries of transportation plans. \n39 On Track Chart 18, these are shown as a single 1.8-degree curve.  The division into Curves 5.2 and 5.1, \ndescribed in the table, results from analysis of recent track geometry car data. \n 6-30\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nGreensboro  \n(Track Charts 19-20) \nGreensboro‚éØthe site of an important yard (Pomona) and a major junction on the NS \nsystem‚éØis an area of special complexity, as depicted in Figure 6-11. \nFigure 6-11: Overview of Greensboro \n \nIntroduction to Greensboro \nRoutes converging at Greensboro, all operated and/or owned by NS, comprise: \n‚Ä¢ The P Line; \n‚Ä¢ The H Line; \n‚Ä¢ The line from Pomona to Winston Salem and Rural Hall, and \n‚Ä¢ The line from Pomona to Sanford, North Carolina. \nElm Interlocking, at the north end of Greensboro, is located at the intersection of the P \nLine with the H Line to Raleigh; the historic Southern Railway station site is at Elm.  Cox \nInterlocking is located some two miles south of Pomona Yard. \n 6-31\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nPomona Yard and an intermodal yard are located on the east40 side of the Main Line, \nsouth40 of central Greensboro. At present, all Amtrak trains stop at the station/yard tower \nadjacent to Pomona Yard.  \nFreight cars for local delivery on the lines radiating from Greensboro are handled at \nPomona Yard.  NS trains originating at or bound for Spencer Yard at Linwood, near Salisbury  \n(the primary classification yard on the Piedmont Main Line, some 40 miles south of Pomona) \nuse the main tracks at Pomona to set off and pick up cars pertaining to the Greensboro area.  \nThese yard-related operations impact main line movements and have implications for the future \nof this line. \n \nGreensboro Station Relocation  \nIntegral to the development of the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte \nCorridor would be the relocation of the existing Greensboro \nStation to the former Southern Railway‚Äôs downtown station. \nThe existing station is the first floor of the Pomona Yard \ntower building located three miles south of the historic downtown \nGreensboro station.  At the existing station, Track 1 is the \nnorthward track and Track 2 is the southward track. The existing \npassenger station/platform is located adjacent to Track 2, on the west side of the right-of-way, \nwhich requires trains in both directions to use the same track‚éØthus creating a bottleneck. \nFigure 6-12:  \nExisting Greensboro Station \n \n  \nFigure 6-13: Historic and Future \nGreensboro Station \nPlans call for remodeling the former station (the \nGreensboro Southern Railway Depot, Figure 6-13) into a new \nintermodal passenger terminal, serving intercity rail, intercity \nbuses, and City transit buses. Built in 1927, the building‚éØone \nof North Carolina's most impressive passenger stations‚éØwas \ndonated to the City of Greensboro in 1978, when Amtrak \nmoved to the current location. Designed by a New York \narchitectural firm, Fellheimer and Wagner, the building has a \nmain waiting room with an impressive mural of the Southern \nRailway network during the 1920's. \nRehabilitation of the historic station would include (among other features) completion \nof the Amtrak spaces, reconstruction of the pedestrian track subway, two low-level island \nplatforms, and a new baggage tunnel. The first platform would be located between the NS \nPiedmont Main Line tracks to Washington, D.C., and the second between the two projected H \nLine tracks. This arrangement, coupled with the contemplated track layout improvements in \nGreensboro, would provide valuable operating flexibility. The Piedmont Authority for Regional \nTransportation is considering a possible commuter service between Greensboro and Winston \nSalem, as well as options for linking Winston-Salem with the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte intercity rail \n                                                 \n40 All directions are railroad directions rather than compass directions.

Figure 6-14 provides a \nfocused view of these improvements.   \nFigure 6-14: Close-up of Greensboro \nEnglish Siding \nEnglish, a new passing siding, would be added to the H Line east of its junction with the \nP line at the historic Greensboro station.  English Siding would provide a location where43: \n‚Ä¢ A westward freight train on the H Line to Pomona or Spencer Yards may be \nheld without blocking passenger trains; \n‚Ä¢ A freight train from the P Line, entering the single-track H Line in the \neastbound direction, can be held until an oncoming (opposing) westward \nfreight or passenger train passes; \n                                                 \n41 For a discussion of the concept of access between Winston Salem and the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor, see the \n‚ÄúImportant Note on the Environmental Process‚Äù in Chapter 1. \n42 Further information on this important project appears in NCDOT‚Äôs comprehensive rail web site \n(http://www.bytrain.org/passenger/ stationimp/igreensboro.html), from which Figure 6-12 and Figure 6-13 and the \ndescription of the station were obtained. \n43 In the following discussion, the reader is reminded that the H Line‚éØincluding the proposed English Siding‚éØ \nruns east and west. \n 6-33\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ An eastbound freight train entering the H Line but unable to reach and enter \nthe next siding (at McCleansville) without delaying other traffic, can be held \nuntil an eastbound passenger train passes. In the absence of the English \nSiding, the freight train would have to occupy a busy P Line track; and \n‚Ä¢ Opposing H Line passenger trains may stop simultaneously at Greensboro \nstation (English Siding would constitute a second H Line station track at \nGreensboro). \nElm Interlocking \n(Track Chart 19) \nElm Interlocking, just south \nof the junction of the H and P Lines, \nwould be reconfigured with Number \n20 crossovers (45 mph). Parallel \nroutes would enable trains to and \nfrom the H Line to make \nsimultaneous moves, as shown in \nFigure 6-15. \n   \nAt Pomona Yard \n (Track Chart 20; Figure 6-16) \nTo assure reliability where a \nbusy freight yard coexists with \nhigh-speed passenger routes \nrequires ample track capacity and \nconnectivity parallel to the yard.  \nOnly in this manner can often time-\nconsuming freight yard operations \nbe kept off the main through tracks, \nthus protecting reliability in both the \nfreight and passenger services.  Such is the need at Pomona Yard, where major track additions \nwould be necessary.  \nFigure 6-15: Schematic‚ÄîGreensboro/ \nElm Interlocking Before and After Improvement \n(Directions are Approximate) \n \nA new \"Pomona Running Track\" would be constructed between the Intermodal \nTerminal and Aycock Street to prevent long working freight trains from blocking other \nworking freight trains. Northward working freight trains would enter Track 3 at the relocated \nCox Interlocking and proceed to the Intermodal Terminal, where they would enter the new \nrunning track at yard speed, without stopping. The running track would enable intermodal \ntrains to make set-offs directly into the Intermodal Terminal and/or pick-ups from the track east \nof the Pomona Running Track, or the Intermodal Terminal.  Other working freight trains would \nbe able to pull north, to approximately Aycock Street, to ensure that the rear of the intermodal \ntrain would have cleared the Intermodal Terminal. The Pomona Running Track also would \nenable southward freight trains of any length to work clear of both main tracks and enable \n 6-34\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nnorthward and southward freight trains to work independently and in parallel without conflict.  \nAccessing the Running Track would require that southward freight trains cross Track 1 at both \nCox and Elm Interlockings.   \nThese improvements are designed to enable freight trains in either direction to work off \nthe running track, unless the running track is in use by another working freight train.  If this \nsituation arises, the second freight train would work from Track 1.44  In this manner, at least \none main track will always be open‚éØa distinct improvement from today‚Äôs situation in which \nboth main tracks are blocked when two trains are working simultaneously at Pomona Yard.  \nThe simulation indicated that the recommended configuration and operations achieved \nthe desired objective of enabling northward and southward freight trains to work at Pomona \nYard without interfering with passenger train and through-freight train operations. \nFigure 6-16: Schematic of Pomona and Cox \n(Directions are Approximate) \n \n \nCox Interlocking \nAs shown in Figure 6-16, Cox Interlocking would be relocated and reconfigured.  A \nright-hand Number 20 (45 mph) turnout would provide access to Track 3, which would be \nextended southward from the Rail Street grade crossing, where it now dead-ends.  As Track 3 \nformerly extended further south than it does today, the extended track would be constructed \nwhere a track once existed.  An 80 mph left hand Number 32 crossover, between Track 1 and \nTrack 2, is contemplated to accommodate the large numbers of trains that divert at Cox \ninterlocking. \n                                                 \n44 If the second freight train is short enough, i.e. under 5,000 feet long, it may be able to work from Track 3, thus \ncompletely freeing up the main line tracks. \n 6-35\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nSignaling on Track 3 would extend from Cox northward to the Intermodal Terminal at \nMP P287.2.  From that point northward to Aycock Street, MP P285.5, Track 3 would not be \nsignaled; it would be operated under yard rules under control of a yardmaster. \nGreensboro‚ÄìCharlotte (P Line‚éØRuns North and South) \nA portion of NS‚Äôs Piedmont Main Line between Washington and Atlanta, the \nGreensboro‚ÄìCharlotte segment of the SEC holds the key to the on-time performance of the \nentire Corridor.  Capacity improvements must occur here if the goals‚éØparticularly the \nreliability goals‚éØof intercity passenger trains and NS freight trains are to be met.  The line \nwould also be upgraded for increased passenger train speeds up to 110 mph, although \nnumerous restricted speed locations would remain. Fortunately, the P Line‚éØreflecting its long-\nterm status as a prominent and continuously upgraded main line‚éØis not as sharply curved as \nthe remainder of the Richmond to Charlotte corridor.  Thus, with one exception, increasing \nsuperelevation and shifting the tracks to increase spiral lengths will suffice to significantly \nincrease the speeds. \nThe projected increase in intercity rail service, with markedly improved travel times, \nwould require additional track capacity between Greensboro and Charlotte for high-speed trains \nto overtake freight and other passenger trains. The P Line‚éØat one time double-tracked all the \nway from Washington to Atlanta‚éØwas reduced, in part, to single-track status during the last \ndecades of the 20th Century.  Generally, a single track railroad‚éØhowever well signaled and \ndispatched‚éØcannot match the capacity of an analogous double-track configuration.  For this \nreason, all previously-removed segments of double track between Greensboro and Charlotte \nwould need to be restored as a prerequisite to high-speed service.  Beyond that, over one-fifth \nof the route between Greensboro and Charlotte would need to be triple-tracked.45,46 Appropriate \ninterlocking modifications would be constructed.  The changes in track configuration would \nease congestion, ensure schedule adherence, offset capacity constraints, and accommodate the \nincreased level of freight and intercity passenger trains. \n                                                 \n45 Major segments of triple track contemplated between Greensboro and Charlotte are as follows: \n \nBetween‚Äî ‚ÄîAnd \nNew triple track \ninstalled \nTotal triple \ntrack installed and/or \nupgraded \nLocation \nApproximate  \nMP Location \nApproximate \nMP feet miles feet miles \nPomona 284 Cox 289 7,000 1.33 28,502 5.40 \nThomasville 307 Bowers 311 25,430 4.82 25,430 4.82 \nYadkin 329 Salisbury Junction 333 31,056 5.88 31,056 5.88 \nKannapolis 350 Adams 353 13,379 2.53 13,379 2.53 \nJunker 372 A.T. & O.

In the case of the SEC, there is no alternative to \nthe P Line. \n 6-36\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nAs the major component of a partial triple-tracking, three center sidings on the P Line \nwould enable passenger trains to overtake freight trains: \n‚Ä¢ Thomasville (near MP 307) to Bowers (near MP 311) \n‚Ä¢ Yadkin (near MP 329) to Salisbury Junction (near MP 333) \n‚Ä¢ Kannapolis (near MP 350) to Adams (near MP 353) \nAdditional capacity in the vicinity of freight yards in Greensboro (as discussed above), \nSpencer, Salisbury, and Charlotte would be achieved by upgrading yard and other non-main \ntracks to third main tracks. \nThe sidings would not eliminate the possibility that passenger trains may have to divert \nto the opposite track to overtake freight trains.47 A diverted passenger train would lose a \nminimum of three minutes per crossover move, for a total of six minutes per diversion.48 \nHowever, as previously described, the lost time could be significantly greater if it needs to \nfollow a freight train for a number of miles before the second track becomes available. \nAnalyses performed for this study indicated that local freight trains would cause the \nmost diversions between Greensboro and Charlotte. For example, in a seven-day simulation, \nnorthward Train NC02 leaving Charlotte at 0600 was the most frequently delayed passenger \ntrain. On a typical day NC02 might diverge three times (i.e., change tracks six times) between \nCharlotte and Greensboro to meet or overtake through freight trains, local freight trains, and \ncommuter trains operating between Charlotte and Concord.  These congestion effects delayed \nthe departure of Train NC02 from Greensboro by as much as 12 minutes during the 7 simulated \ndays of operation49‚éØa result that would have been far worse had the contemplated \nimprovements not augmented the assumed capacity of the P Line. This example graphically \ndemonstrates how active the P Line is, and how requisite the capacity additions would be to \nreliable high-speed passenger service upon it.  When service is actually ready to begin, the \nprocess of timetable construction would need to take these simulation results into account by \ninserting ‚Äúpad‚Äù into the schedule for the trains most likely to be so affected. \nGreensboro‚ÄìSalisbury \n(MPs P289.4‚ÄìP322.8; Track Charts 20‚Äì23) \nTable 6-6 lists the track additions and the single curve realignment contemplated in the \nregion between Greensboro and Salisbury. \nTable 6-6: Improvements in the Region Between Greensboro and Salisbury \nLocation \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLocation\nMP Contemplated Relocations \nP289.3‚Äì\nP298 \nCox to Hoskins.

If a freight train \nwere diverted, it would occupy the opposite track longer than a passenger train, thereby reducing capacity. \n48 There would be two crossover moves per diversion: one to reach the opposite track, the other to return to the \nnormative track. \n49 That is, the train‚Äôs departure was up to 12 minutes later than it would have been had the diversions not been \nnecessary. \n 6-37\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nP296.6-\nP297.2 \nCurve 296 would be realigned to reduce curvature \nfrom 2.5 degrees to 2-degrees; this would eliminate \nan 80-mph restrictive curve in a 25-mile section of \notherwise high-speed running. \n  \nP307‚Äì\nP314 \n(Track \nChart 22) \nThomas to Lake.  The Piedmont Main Line \nis currently double tracked from Hoskins to \nBowers (now at MP 309.8). A center siding \nwould be installed between MP 306.9, south \nof Thomasville, and Bowers, which would be \nrelocated to MP 311.4, north of a 2-degree \ncurve. Bowers would be configured to \nprovide universal move capabilities with \nNumber 20 (45 mph) crossovers. Lake, now \nlocated at MP P314, would be eliminated as \nsuperfluous.  \nThe five-mile segment between Bowers and \nLake‚éØnow single-tracked‚éØwould be \nconverted to double track.  \n \nSpencer Yard and Salisbury \n(MP P322.8‚ÄìP334; Track Charts 23 and 24) \nThe twelve-mile segment between Spencer Yard and Salisbury (inclusive) contains one \nof the principal freight car classification facilities in the NS system as well as an important \njunction between the P Line and the route to Asheville, North Carolina.  This segment is \ndepicted in Figure 6-17. \nSpencer Yard \nBuilt in the 1970s, Spencer Yard at Linwood, North Carolina is NS‚Äôs largest yard in the \nState.  \nLocated approximately eight miles north of Salisbury Station, Spencer Yard functions \nas a hub for NS operations. Trains from distant points arrive at Spencer; they set off cars, which \nare classified, or pick up cars, which have been classified.  About twelve inbound trains daily \narrive from the north or south to have their cars classified to about the same number of \noutbound trains.  Spencer also serves as a distribution point for local freight trains that switch \nindustries along the P Line. \nIn comparison with other yards in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte corridor, Spencer Yard is \ncarefully designed and modern.  In general, it has the capacity, in terms of receiving and \ndeparture tracks, to process incoming and outgoing freight trains without creating a bottleneck \non the adjacent P Line. Still, the layout at the south end of the yard (at Duke Interlocking) \n‚éØsited on a short piece of straight track between curves‚éØdoes not provide sufficient space for \ndesirable improvements in the traffic flow between Spencer Yard, Salisbury, and the Asheville \nline.  As a result, several improvements are contemplated in the area between Yad and \nSalisbury Junction, and in the connection between Salisbury Junction and the Asheville branch. \n \n \n 6-38\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n Figure 6-17: Spencer Yard and Salisbury \nOperating Challenges Between Spencer and Salisbury Junction \nTrains to or from Asheville (about ten movements50 per day) leave or enter the P Line \ntowards Spencer on the double-tracked North Wye at Salisbury Junction. The interlocking is \narranged so that northward trains from the Asheville Line can cross Track 2 to access Track 1 \nwhile a southward train is also entering the Asheville Line from Track 2.  However, the \nexisting P Line crossovers providing access to the North Wye are sandwiched between curves.  \nThe speed of trains on the North Wye is restricted to 15 mph, and this may cause long freight \ntrains to occupy the interlocking at Salisbury for five to eight minutes, depending upon whether \nthe train is stopped or not.51  \nBecause of these existing constraints at Salisbury Junction, the initial operating analysis \nindicated that trains coming from the Asheville Line in the future might not be able to cross the \n                                                 \n50 Total of both directions. \n51 Additional information pertinent to the junction of the P and Asheville lines: \n‚Ä¢ The Asheville Line is double-tracked for 2.1 miles to Majolica, where the line becomes single-tracked.  \n‚Ä¢ A South Wye provides a connection for Asheville Line trains to the P Line south of Salisbury. \n 6-39\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nflow of southward trains on Track 2 to access Track 1, travel 6 miles to Duke Interlocking, and \nreturn to Track 2 to enter the Spencer Yard.   \nNew ‚ÄúYad‚Äù Interlocking; Center Siding to Salisbury; Salisbury Junction Revision \nTo lessen the operating constraints in the Spencer‚ÄìSalisbury area, a coordinated set of \nimprovements is contemplated. \n South of the Yadkin River Bridge at MP 328.6, a new interlocking (‚ÄúYad‚Äù) would be \nconstructed.  From that point, a new center siding would extend as far south as Salisbury \nJunction, which would be rebuilt.  \nThe center siding would eliminate: \n‚Ä¢ Any conflict of northbound Asheville Line freight trains with northward \nthrough running trains on Track 1; and \n‚Ä¢ The need for the simultaneous windows on Tracks 1 and 2 to access Track 1 \nfrom the Wye at Salisbury Junction. \nA portion of Salisbury Junction would be relocated northward about 1500 feet to ensure \nthat turnouts and crossovers are on tangent track.  As part of this reconfiguration, the Asheville \nLine tracks would be extended northward parallel to the P Line.  These improvements would \nassure parallel routes for continued simultaneous operation of northbound and southbound \nAsheville Line freight trains‚éØbut at a top speed of 30 mph, double the present maximum for \nAsheville moves. The benefits of this shift become apparent in Figure 6-18.  \nCrossings in Salisbury \n Numerous highway crossings are located on curves in Salisbury. The crossings would \nbe difficult to eliminate and therefore it is envisioned to maintain their current superelevation \nand alignment and restrict passenger train speeds to 70 mph through the City of Salisbury.52\nSalisbury Station \nThe Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor will intensify the use of the existing Salisbury \nStation building. Constructed in 1908 by the Southern Railway, the building is an excellent \nexample of mission style architecture and represents the importance of Salisbury's location on \nthe railroad, lying halfway between Washington and Atlanta and at the eastern terminus of the \n                                                 \n52 Chapter 5 contains a discussion of the effect on train speed of crossings located on curves. \n 6-40\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nFigure 6-18: Schematic, Yad to Salisbury \n \nWestern North Carolina Railroad to Asheville and Tennessee. The building is part of \nSalisbury's Historic District. (See Figure 6-19.)  In 1984, \nthe Historic Salisbury Foundation, Inc. acquired the \nstation, saving it from demolition. They raised over $3 \nmillion in private donations and beautifully restored the \nmain waiting room and other parts of the station. The \nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation contributed \nan additional $1 million in enhancement funds to finish \nthe restoration of the main building for civic purposes.  \nNCDOT also has contributed funds for the creation of a \ntransitional park to the east of the station, linking the \ndowntown to the station. The NCDOT completed an enlarged temporary waiting room in \nDecember 1999. Platform, canopy and track rehabilitation will be carried out in a future \nphase.53\nFigure 6-19: Salisbury Station \n \nCurrently, one passenger platform exists along Track 2 between Kerr Street and Council \nStreet. Consequently, all northward passenger trains stopping at Salisbury have to operate left-\nhanded on Track 2 between Reid (MP P337.3) and at least Salisbury Junction (MP 333). That \npractice would be unsatisfactory for future operations as it constrains both freight and \n                                                 \n53 The source for the picture and description of Salisbury Station is the NCDOT web site, \nhttp://www.bytrain.org/passenger/stationimp/isalisbury.html.  \n 6-41\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\npassenger flows on this busy railroad. Therefore, platforms would be located adjacent to both \nTracks 1 and 2. \nProvisions would also made to add a platform and new tracks on the west side of the \nstation area to accommodate future passenger trains to Asheville, but these tracks would not be \nbuilt until such service is implemented. \nYadkin Junction \nYadkin Junction at MP 334.5, which is about one mile south of Salisbury Station, \nconsists of a run-around track adjacent to Track 1 and a hand-operated turnout to the former \nYadkin Railroad (now the NS line to Albemarle). One train per day has been assumed to \noperate to and from the branch. No change is proposed for this location. \nSalisbury‚ÄìCharlotte \n(MP 337.3‚Äì375.3; Track Charts 24 Through 28) \nThis section of the busy P Line will also require substantial restoration and expansion of \ntrack capacity to accommodate projected traffic volumes.  These additions are detailed in Table \n6-7. \nTable 6-7: Improvements in the Region Between Salisbury and Charlotte \nLocation \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLocation\nMP Other Improvements \nP337.3‚Äì\nP347.3 \nReid to North Kannapolis.  Double track currently \nremains in place between Salisbury and Reid (MP \nP337.3).  However, the segment between Reid and \nNorth Kannapolis (MP 347.3) has only a single track, \non which active industries are located.  To minimize \nconflicts with local freight service when passenger \ntraffic increases, the double track between Reid and \nNorth Kannapolis would be restored.  This segment of \ndouble track reconstruction should have a high \npriority.  For improved spacing of crossovers, Reid \nInterlocking would be eliminated and a new universal \ninterlocking, ‚ÄúSumner,‚Äù installed at a point about \nmidway between Salisbury Junction and North \nKannapolis, at approximately MP 339.5. \n \n P349.5‚ÄìP354.1 \nKannapolis‚ÄìAdams.  North Kannapolis (MP P347.4) \nto Haydock (MP P360.1) is double tracked. \nKannapolis and Concord are located in this segment. \nInterlocked crossovers at Adams (MP P354) are \nlocated approximately midway between North \nKannapolis and Haydock. \n The third of the three center sidings between \nCharlotte and Greensboro would begin at Kann (MP \nP349.5), at the north end of the long 1-degree curve \n(East C Street), and end at Winecoff School Road, at \na relocated Adams Interlocking (MP P352.9). The \nP352.7 \nAdams Overnight Commuter Equipment \nStorage.  Depending on the design of a \nCharlotte‚ÄìConcord commuter service, an \novernight equipment storage facility may need to \nbe provided near Adams Interlocking, north of \nConcord.  Such a facility is not included in the \nschematics prepared for this monograph. \n 6-42\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nLocation \nMP Contemplated Track Additions \nLocation\nMP Other Improvements \n siding is much shorter than desired, but the 317-foot \nbridge over I-85 prevents the end of the siding from \nbeing extended farther south, to Adams, at a \nreasonable cost. \n Despite the short length of the siding, a clear space \nof nearly two miles would exist so that a freight train \ncan be held without blocking any highway crossings. \n \nP367 \nI-485 Station.  Although located some ten \nmiles north of Charlotte, this new station is \ndiscussed in the section on that city, below. It is \nenvisioned as a basic facility, with low side \nplatforms adjacent to each of the two main \ntracks. \nP360.1‚Äì\nP371.2 \nHaydock ‚ÄìJunker.  Haydock (MP P360.1) to Junker \n(MP 371.2), a distance of about twelve miles, \ncurrently is single-tracked. It is contemplated to \nrestore double track between Haydock and Junker. \nThe segment between Adams and Junker is about \neighteen miles. It is recommended that a new \nuniversal interlocking, Shamrock, be located about \nhalfway between those locations, at about MP P363, \njust north of Shamrock Road.  When double track is \nrestored, Haydock Interlocking would be removed, \nand Junker would be relocated to MP P372.2 and \nreconfigured as the gateway to an expanded rail \ninfrastructure in Charlotte. The new I-485 Station \nwould be located in this segment, as described in the \nnext column. \n \nCharlotte \n(Track Charts 28 Through 30) \nFigure 6-20 provides an overview of the Charlotte vicinity; it shows not only Charlotte \nproper with the contemplated center-city station location, but also the new stations at I-485 and \nthe Charlotte airport.   \nStations in the Charlotte Region \nIn this metropolitan area of 1.5 million people, the excellent distribution and access \nprovided by three well-located stations would contribute to the demand for high-speed rail \ncorridor service. \nI-485 Station \nPrior analysis identified the need for a ‚Äúbeltway‚Äù-type station to be located north of \nCharlotte in the vicinity of MP P367, where I-485 passes over the rail line.54 University City \nBoulevard parallels the rail line at this location. The station would serve the rapidly \ndevelopingsuburban area north and east of Charlotte. All intercity passenger trains are assumed \nto stop at the station, as well as proposed Concord‚ÄìCharlotte commuter trains.  \n \n                                                 \n54 Such ‚Äúbeltway‚Äù stations have proven to be successful in Boston (Route 128), New York (Metropark), and \nWashington (Capital Beltway); the latter two trace their origins to the Metroliner demonstration program of the \n1960s and 70s, catalyzed by the FRA‚Äôs Office of High-Speed Ground Transportation. \n 6-43\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n Figure 6-20: Overview of Charlotte Showing I-485 and Airport Stations \nCharlotte Station Relocation \nCharlotte's existing Amtrak station (Figure 6-21) is located \ntwo miles from of the center of the city. The current station was \nbuilt in 1968 after Southern Railway tore down its old uptown \nstation and consolidated passenger operations to its Charlotte freight \nyard on Tryon Street. With increased passenger rail services and rail \ntravel demand, the station's small size and suboptimal location no \nlonger fit the requirements of passengers traveling to and from \nCharlotte. Furthermore, the passenger operations must be relocated \nto accommodate increasing Norfolk Southern freight operations.  \nFigure 6-21:  \nExisting Charlotte Station \nTo better meet current needs, NCDOT and Amtrak have \n 6-44\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nalready expanded the existing station‚Äôs waiting room and added a second ticket window. These, \nhowever, are short-term measures only; a new, better-located station would be a more viable \noption for the future. \nIn April 2002 the NCDOT completed a feasibility study that identifies a site in uptown \nCharlotte for an intermodal passenger terminal (designated as ‚ÄúProposed Station‚Äù near the \ncenter of Figure 6-21).  The NCDOT study includes conceptual plans for the station and \nassociated track improvements.  The new facility would handle upwards of 500,000 rail \npassengers annually by 2015.  Envisioned to have a useful life of 50 years or more, this large \nand significant project would incorporate all modes of land-based passenger transportation \nincluding conventional and high-speed intercity passenger rail, local and regional bus and rail, \nintercity bus, rental cars, bicycles and pedestrians.  \nAs contemplated in the present study, the intercity passenger rail portion of the \nstation‚éØsituated at MP P377.9‚éØwould consist of three tracks and two platforms.  Details on \nthe envisioned track layout through Charlotte appear further below. \nNCDOT is currently purchasing the property for the new facility, which a public/private \npartnership would fund and construct. 55   \nCharlotte Airport Station \nConstructed in the early 1980s, the Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport \nRail Station has demonstrated the potential value of rail/air intermodal facilities, which can also \nattract significant rail traffic from nearby suburban communities.  The success of the BWI \nconnection has resulted in plans for a similar connection at Greene Airport in Providence, \nRhode Island and has led to the concept of constructing an intermodal rail-air station adjacent \nto Charlotte Airport, near the Airport Freeway. The airport is located approximately six miles \nwest of downtown Charlotte, adjacent to the P Line. A rail passenger servicing and storage yard \nwould be constructed south of the Airport Station. \nRail Operations in Charlotte \nThe following operational challenges in the Charlotte area drive the facility concept \ndeveloped in this study: \n‚Ä¢ An important at-grade rail/rail crossing at Graham Interlocking, in which \nthe single-track CSXT crosses the double-track P Line of the NS.  Over this \ncrossing, some 25 daily CSXT moves (including yard moves) must pass.   \nFurthermore, the crossing is located on a curve, which restricts train speeds \non the NS at Graham. \n‚Ä¢ An active freight yard on the east side of the right-of-way.  Charlotte \nYard, like Pomona Yard, is located east of the Piedmont Main Line.  It is \nprojected that of the approximately 30 daily P Line freight train movements \n                                                 \n55 More detailed information on this important project is available on the NCDOT‚Äôs rail web site at \nhttp://www.bytrain.org/passenger/stationimp/charlottemm/legisupdate.html. That site is the source for the picture \nand general description of the Charlotte intermodal terminal.  The track layout as described in this monograph was \ndeveloped for the present study. \n 6-45\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nenvisioned to pass through the Charlotte Station area in 2020, approximately \n10 movements in each direction would call at the Charlotte Yard‚éØseveral \nmerely to change crews (a ten-minute stop), the majority to pick up or set off \ncars at the yard (for periods of 45 to 60 minutes).  Southbound freight trains \ncalling at the yard must cross the northbound main track upon entering and \nupon exiting the yard.  Crossovers at A.T.& O. Junction and south of the \nyard are used to move between the yard and the P Line. These crossovers are \nless than a mile apart. By tying up the crossovers for extended periods,56 \nlong trains can prevent trains traveling in the opposite direction from \nworking at the yard, and sometimes from moving at all. Therefore, the \npotential for conflicts among trains exists, just as at Pomona. \n‚Ä¢ An interlocking (A.T. & O. Junction) with particularly difficult \ngeometry.  A.T. & O Junction is partially located on a 1.8-degree curve with \ntwo inches of superelevation.  All turnouts and crossovers are Number 10s, \nwhich limit train speeds into or out of the yard or to the NS route to \nStatesville and Winston Salem to 15 mph.  For all practical purposes, freight \ntrains in this yard area cannot exceed 5 mph because they need to be able to \ncome to a stop within very short distances.  Thus, freight operations tie up \nthe interlocking at A.T. & O. Junction for significant periods of time. \n‚Ä¢ Twenty-two projected commuter moves per day into and out of Charlotte \n(including nonrevenue runs);  \n‚Ä¢ Twenty-two projected intercity passenger moves through Charlotte each \nday; and \n‚Ä¢ The need to provide necessary and sufficient support facilities for servicing, \nturning, or storing all the commuter, and most of the intercity, passenger \ntrains.57 \nFacility Needs and Their Rationale \nFigure 6-22 presents a set of facilities that would respond to these challenges.  \n                                                 \nFigure 6-22: Charlotte Rail Facilities as Contemplated \n56 With the existing configuration, a single 8,000-foot freight train entering the yard at 5 mph can block main line \ntraffic for up to 18 minutes.   \n 6-46\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nThe train paths described below and in Figure 6-23 are those intended for normal operations; \nthe contemplated track layout incorporates sufficient flexibility for dispatchers to accommodate \nunusual situations by setting up alternate paths. \nImproved Path for Southbound Working Freights \n[Figure 6-23(B)] \nA third track, new Track 3, would be installed between the relocated Junker \nInterlocking (MP 372.2; see Table 6-7) and A. T. & O. Junction (MP 375.3).  Junker, with its \nNumber 20 turnouts, would enable southward freight trains working at Charlotte Yard to enter \nTrack 3 at 40 mph‚éØa speed boost that is essential to free flow on the busy main line. Track 3 \nalso would provide a holding location for a southward freight train to wait short of the \nCharlotte Yard without blocking Track 2.  \nA new connecting track (designated in this monograph as ‚ÄúTrack 4‚Äù) leading southward \nout of AT&O Jct. would parallel, and be isolated from, the switching ladder at the north end of \nthe yard so that standing or arriving working freight trains would not block switching \noperations. Track 4 would tie into the existing easternmost track in the yard, which is adjacent \nto the Intermodal Terminal, and would be upgraded to become a new running track between \nA.T. & O. Junction and Tryon Street.   \nFrom Tryon Street to a new ‚ÄúStadium‚Äù Interlocking,58 just south of the Charlotte \nIntermodal Terminal, Track 4 would be signaled.  After working in the yard, southward freights \nwould cross northbound Track 1 at Stadium and would merge with other southbound traffic on \nTrack 2.  Stadium would have Number 20 (40 mph) turnouts as well, thus expediting the \ncrossover move. \nImproved Path for Northbound Working Freights \nFigure 6-23(C) \nAt Stadium, northbound working freights would divert from Track 1 to an upgraded \nTrack 3, and would then proceed to their working location near MP 375.5 without affecting \nother NS freight trains or passenger trains. However, northbound working freights would have \nto cross the CSXT tracks at grade, at Graham Interlocking.  Since the northward freight train \nworking location is about 7,500 feet from the CSXT at-grade crossing, nearly all P Line freight \ntrains should be able to work with the rear of the train clear of the CSXT crossing.  However, \nLidell Street may be blocked; that street crossing should be evaluated for possible closure or \nseparation. Relatively short northward working freight trains that arrive before the previous \nworking train departs would wait south of the CSXT crossing, leaving the crossing clear for \nCSXT trains.  \nA.T. & O. Junction would be reconfigured to enable freight trains to access Track 1 at \n30 mph (over Number 15 turnouts) upon completing work. A new interlocked crossover from \nTrack 3 to Track 1 would replace an existing hand-operated crossover between the yard and \nTrack 1.  \n                                                                                                                                                           \n57 For Charlotte‚Äôs likely enduring role as a terminus, see Chapter 3 \n58 So named because of its proposed location next to Erickson Stadium. \n 6-47\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \n6-\n48\n \nFi\ngu\nre\n 6\n-2\n3:\n T\nra\nin\n P\nat\nhw\nay\ns U\nnd\ner\nly\nin\ng \nC\nha\nrl\not\nte\n R\nec\non\nfig\nur\nat\nio\nn \n \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nTrack 3 would have a 40 mph maximum speed between Stadium and A.T. & O. Junction.  \nThis increase over yard speed would occur because (1) Track 3 would be signaled between \nStadium and Tryon Street; (2) the hand-operated crossovers south of Tryon Street would be \nelectrically locked; and (3) all switches on Track 3, between Tryon Street and A.T. &O, \nJunction, would have switch locks installed.  As a result, long freight trains that have finished \ntheir work would be able to accelerate to 30 mph prior to accessing the main P Line tracks, thus \ncontributing to the capacity and fluidity of the P Line. \nIn this manner, both north- and southbound freight trains would be able to work at the \nCharlotte Yard, without conflicting with each other. The goal of enabling passenger trains and \nnon-working freight trains to have their own tracks in the congested Charlotte area ‚éØseparate \nfrom those used by working freight trains‚éØ would be achieved. \nPaths for Through Trains; Charlotte Intermodal Passenger Terminal \nTracks 1 and 2 between A.T. & O. Junction and Stadium would be the passenger tracks \nthrough Charlotte, and would also accommodate through freight trains that need not stop at \nCharlotte Yard. \nThe new Charlotte Intermodal Terminal, located at MP 377.9, would have the following \narrangement: \n‚Ä¢ Track 2, normally southbound, with a side platform to its west; \n‚Ä¢ Track 1, normally northbound; and \n‚Ä¢ A third station track, sharing a center platform with Track 1.  \nThe normal paths for through passenger and freight trains at Charlotte appear in Figure 6-\n23(D) and (E). \nDepending on the design of future Charlotte‚ÄìConcord and other commuter services, there \nmay be a need for daytime train storage facilities near the Charlotte Intermodal Terminal.  Such \nfacilities are not included in the schematics prepared for this monograph.  \nNS Freight Trains to and From Columbia \nIt is assumed that most southward freight trains to Columbia would operate left \nhanded‚éØthat is, on Track 1‚éØfor about 1¬Ω miles between Stadium and North Advance/Charlotte \nJunction, where the NS route due south to Columbia diverges from the P Line to Atlanta.  To \nexpedite movements to and from the Columbia line and enhance P Line capacity, a left hand \nNumber 15 (30 mph) turnout at North Advance would be upgraded to a Number 20 (40 mph for \nfreight) turnout.   \nProvisions for Additional Future Commuter Services \nIn all hypothetical schedules, simulations, and related cost estimates, this study made \nspecific provision for a commuter service as envisioned by the City of Charlotte between \nCharlotte and Concord.  Other rail commuter services are ultimately possible in this large \nmetropolitan region. In the conceptual design of the Charlotte Station, allowances were made for \nthe following two possible commuter operations: \n 6-49\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Possible service: Charlotte‚ÄìMonroe (CSXT).  The concept in Figure 6-23 \nallows for construction, east of the station, of two tracks and a center platform \nexpressly for a possible future commuter service to Monroe via a former SAL, \nnow CSXT, line.59  Such a service would require a connection between the station \ntracks and the CSXT at Graham.   \n‚Ä¢ Charlotte‚ÄìStatesville (NS).  A former Southern Railway, now NS, line diverges \nfrom the P Line at Charlotte in the direction of Mooresville, where it bifurcates \nnorthwest to Statesville and northeast to Winston-Salem. A freight-only \nconnection between the P Line and the Statesville line exists today at A.T. & O. \nJunction, as shown in Figure 6-23; the station concept allows for future \nreconstruction of a track leading from the Charlotte Station area to the Statesville \nline. Such a reconstruction would require reinstallation of the diamond crossing of \nthe NS Statesville line and the CSXT. All main platforms and passenger tracks \nwould have direct access to such a Statesville connection. \nThe schematic in Figure 6-24 shows additional detail regarding the provisions for \npossible future commuter services. \nFigure 6-24: Schematic of Charlotte Station \n \n \nAirport Extension and Service Facilities \nExtending the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor to the Charlotte Airport would respond to \nboth marketing and operational dictates.  It would bring high-speed rail directly to the \nairport,‚éØwhere important intermodal transfers can occur, ‚éØand to the population centers west \nand south of Charlotte proper; and it would create a fitting southern terminus for the Richmond‚Äì\n                                                 \n59 This platform and its tracks would not accommodate the main P Line services, as Figure 6-23 shows. \n 6-50\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nCharlotte portion of the Southeast Corridor, where trains to and from Raleigh, Washington, New \nYork, and Boston can be turned and serviced efficiently and effectively. \nDesign of the Airport Station/Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Southern Terminus \nAll intercity passenger trains to and through Charlotte, including any overnight and other \nlong-distance trains,60 were assumed to stop at the Airport station.  Consisting of low-level side \nplatforms adjacent to Tracks 1 and 2, the station would be located adjacent to the Airport \nFreeway. Just south of Little Rock Road, a loop track for turning trains terminating at Charlotte \nwould diverge westward from Track 2, the southbound main track, passing over both main tracks \nand rejoining Track 1, the northbound main track (see schematic in Figure 6-25).  A storage yard \nand equipment servicing and inspection facility (S&I) would be sited to the east of Track 1.  \nPassenger trains not terminating in Charlotte, including any future trains on a possible extension \nof the SEC to Atlanta, Macon, or beyond, 61  would make use of the main line tracks passing \nunder the turning loop. \n  \nThis design would have \nmany advantages over and above \nmarket penetration in the large \nCharlotte region.  Turning trains \nsouth of central Charlotte would \nsimplify operations and consume \nless track capacity in the \ncongested uptown area.  Using a \nloop track and integral S&I \nwould minimize operating costs, \nturnaround times, and equipment \ndowntime: an arriving trainset \nwould change direction, undergo \ncleaning and inspection, and \nprepare for departure in one \nvirtually continuous movement. \nThis concept, therefore, would \nbenefit the economics and marketability of the SEC as a whole. \nFigure 6-25 :  \nSchematic of Contemplated Facilities at Charlotte Airport \nCommuter Considerations at the Airport Station \nThe service plan for the proposed Concord‚ÄìCharlotte commuter operation will influence \nthe design of the facilities at the Charlotte Airport. \n                                                 \n60 The simulation included one New York‚ÄìAtlanta‚ÄìNew Orleans daily round trip, the Crescent, and an additional \ndaily long-distance round trip between Washington and Atlanta via Lynchburg; see Chapter 3. \n61 A proposed Charlotte‚ÄìAtlanta extension is part of the SEC designation, but is just now entering the feasibility \nstudy stage.  Chapter 3 contains more information on that proposal, and the ‚ÄúSupplement: Background Materials‚Äù at \nthe end of this volume contains information on ‚ÄúFunding for Planning an Extension of the SEC to Atlanta and \nMacon, Georgia.‚Äù  The effects of any such extension have not been incorporated in this monograph, beyond the \ndiscussions in Chapter 3 and the Supplement. \n 6-51\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nThe simulations for this study assumed that the southerly terminus of Concord‚ÄìCharlotte \ncommuter service would be the Charlotte Intermodal Terminal. Thirty-minute headways from \nConcord for this service were projected. Layover facilities in Charlotte for day storage of \ncommuter trains‚éØnecessary for efficient operation in the assumed service scheme‚éØhave not yet \nbeen identified. It was assumed that overnight equipment storage facilities would be provided \nsomewhere near Adams Interlocking, as described in Chapter 3. \nIf, on the other hand, local authorities decide to terminate commuter trains at the \nCharlotte Airport instead of the main Charlotte station‚éØ \n‚Ä¢ Day storage of commuter trains will not be necessary in uptown Charlotte, but \ncould be provided by means of additional trackage at the Airport‚éØnot \nincluded in this study‚Äôs proposals; \n‚Ä¢ As simulated, three of the eight commuter trains each morning from Concord \nto Charlotte turned back to Concord for a second trip.  If these trains were to \noperate to and from the Airport, they would not be able to return to Concord \nfor a second trip and additional equipment sets would be required; but \n‚Ä¢ Public service considerations may, in the judgment of local officials, be better \nmet by providing through commuter service to the Airport, an important \nemployment center. \nClearly, subsequent design work for many Charlotte area facilities will reflect public \nchoices in the realm of commuter service as well as intercity operations. \n \n 6-52\n--------------------------------Page

\nRecapitulation of Potential Improvements \nTable 7-1 lists the corridor-wide and site-specific improvements identified in \nChapters 5 and 6 as addressing the Year 2020 goals and requirements underlying the \nstudy.   The table identifies the objectives and estimated cost of each line item.  The \nprojected total cost of all the identified potential improvements (exclusive of rolling stock \nrequirements and other items not estimated in the study) currently stands at from $0.9 to \n$1.0 billion (2000 dollars).   \nTable 7-1 includes cost estimates only for those infrastructure items covered in \nthe study scope.

As an example of segmentation, a major \neffort like the relocation of Raleigh Station and the track reconfiguration between \nSouthern Junction and Ashe, which this monograph describes in broad outlines, would \nlend itself to subdivision into a number of interrelated projects.  The engineers would \nthen evaluate these separate projects in terms of their cost-effectiveness in fulfilling trip-\ntime, capacity, and re-capitalization needs.  Experience on the Northeast Corridor \nImprovement Project has shown that a disproportionately large share of the trip time \nbenefits could result from a relatively small portion of the total costs, thus emphasizing \nthe benefits of prioritization.  Capacity and re-capitalization projects can likewise be \nevaluated for their urgency and return on investment.  Finally, the study‚Äôs 20-year \nplanning horizon allows for a phased implementation9 of the contemplated program to \nmatch the rail operators‚Äô staged introduction of service improvements.  Thus, closer \nscrutiny would assist high-speed rail partners in fashioning a detailed program that is \naffordable, timely, and efficacious. \nMajor Study Conclusions \nThis study of the 338-mile Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor represents the first \napplication of the transportation planning concepts that evolved in the Northeast Corridor \nImprovement Project‚éØAmerica‚Äôs most intensive high-speed rail development effort‚éØto \na predominantly single-track railroad with heavy through and local freight traffic.   \nCapacity Requirements \nThe importance of freight traffic, coupled with the bottlenecks inherent in single-\ntrack operation, makes protecting the reliability of all services a paramount concern in \nplanning‚éØsecondary only to safety.  As a result, for this corridor to meet the States‚Äô \ngoals for travel time and reliability: \n‚Ä¢ Significant additional capacity would need to be provided. \n‚Ä¢ This capacity may take the obvious form of additional tracks, mainly \npassing sidings but in some instances center sidings, and new \ninterlockings. \n‚Ä¢ More subtle‚éØbut of equal importance‚éØare the detailed improvements \nthat would allow freight trains to enter and exit the main line more \nquickly, and that would lessen the delays occasioned by interference \namong all rail services.  These include upgrading turnouts for higher \noperating speeds and providing improved paths for all types of trains \nthrough complex yard areas. \n                                                 \n9 However, phased implementation must always be weighed against obvious one-time opportunities to do \nprojects ‚Äúright the first time,‚Äù as for example when an abandoned route like the S Line is rebuilt free of \ntraffic. \n 7-6\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n‚Ä¢ Combined with the need for careful attention to engineering detail is \nthe requirement for collegial operations planning, over the long term, \namong all the operators and service sponsors in the corridor. \nWith the betterments identified in this study, it would be feasible to upgrade \nintercity passenger service to achieve reliable travel times of 4.5 hours between \nRichmond and Charlotte, 6.5 hours between Washington and Charlotte, and 9.5 hours \nbetween New York and Charlotte.  These timings would approach those incorporated in \nthe FRA‚Äôs 1997 report on the commercial feasibility of high-speed ground transportation, \nwhich emphasized the relatively favorable transportation economics of the Southeast \nCorridor due to its traffic synergy with the Northeast Corridor north of Washington.   \nThese intercity passenger rail service improvements could occur without adverse \nimpacts to freight operations in this very busy territory, or to the commuter services \nenvisioned by the City of Charlotte.  Indeed, all services may stand to benefit from the \nimproved traffic flows made possible by the initiatives described in this monograph. \nThree Corridors In One \nTo make full use of this study‚Äôs findings, transportation planners and public \nofficials need to be aware that this 338-mile corridor consists of three distinct parts, each \nof which demands a distinct engineering treatment, even while meriting unified \nconsideration from the marketing and operational viewpoints: \n‚Ä¢ The S Line between Richmond and Raleigh (157 miles) consists \nmainly of very-light-density freight trackage and an 88-mile stretch of \nabandoned railroad that would need to be rebuilt.  Because of the light \nfreight traffic levels, the existence of a right-of-way, the ability to \nreconstruct free of traffic on the abandoned portion, and the facility‚Äôs \nstatus as the ‚Äúair line‚Äù or shortest route between Richmond and \nRaleigh, the S line constitutes an opportunity for the States to establish \nhigh-speed rail relatively quickly and at a reasonable cost.  \nNoteworthy is the ability to rebuild the S Line ‚Äúright the first \ntime‚Äù‚éØwith time-saving realignments that could, in the absence of \ndaily traffic loads, be built at a very low incremental expenditure. \n‚Ä¢ The H Line between Raleigh and Greensboro (81 miles) carries a \nmoderate freight traffic over a single-track route with an often difficult \nalignment, through freight yards and a number of junctions with other \nlines.  To obtain speed and reliability over the H Line will require a \njudicious combination of passing tracks, realignments, and other \ndetailed local improvements. \n‚Ä¢ The P Line between Greensboro and Charlotte Airport (100 \nmiles)‚éØas the main line of the former Southern Railway, and a key \nlink in today‚Äôs NS network‚éØhas benefited from continuous \nimprovements and carries a heavy freight traffic.  Moreover, the North \n 7-7\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nCarolina points that it serves are themselves important traffic \ngenerators.  Therefore, while only one track realignment is deemed \nnecessary, capacity and reliability concerns would mandate the \nrestoration of all the double track that was removed in the last half of \nthe 20th Century, and the addition of three center passing tracks and \nother stretches of third track.  In addition, major investments are \nneeded at such points as Greensboro and Charlotte to protect the \nreliability of all the future services. \nImplications for Other Corridor Studies \nBecause the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor consists of three distinctive segments, \nthe present study contains information that will be useful to corridor planners in many \nother regions of the country where analogous situations prevail.  Abandoned segments, \nlight-to-medium density single-track freight lines, and heavy freight routes with limited \ncapacity exist in other designated corridors, and the techniques employed to overcome \nthe varied challenges in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte route will apply elsewhere as well.  In \nparticular, planners and decision-makers need to keep in mind the special characteristics \nof single-track routes‚éØand of high-density freight lines‚éØand the careful attention to \noperational planning and engineering detail that is prerequisite to their successful \nadaptation for high-speed rail service.   \n \n \n 7-8\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\nTables in Chapter 7 \nTable 7-1: Potential Improvements in the Richmond‚ÄìCharlotte Corridor ................................... 7-2 \n \n \n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n Glossary \n \nAcronym or \nTerm \n \nMeaning \nABS Automatic Block Signals \nACL The former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, a predecessor company of CSXT. \nADA Americans With Disabilities Act \nA Line The former Atlantic Coast Line main line between Acca Yard, Richmond, \nPetersburg, Charleston, Savannah, and Florida, via Rocky Mount, Wilson, \nand Selma, North Carolina. \nC&O The former Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, a predecessor company of CSXT. \nCP Control point‚Äîa term designating an interlocking, where trains can switch \ntracks.

(CSXT)  have settled a 140-year \nownership dispute over a portion of track near  Raleigh, NC. The agreement opens the door for increased \nrail transit and  economic development in the Triangle and eastern portions of North  Carolina.  \n \nIn September 2000, CSXT filed a property lawsuit disputing ownership of a  200-foot portion of the NCRR \ncorridor between Raleigh and Cary that is  used by CSXT freight trains and Amtrak passenger trains. The \ncorridor also  is proposed for use by the Triangle Transit Authority for its planned  regional rail service.   \n \nUnder the settlement, NCRR, which owns the 317-mile rail corridor between  Morehead City and \nCharlotte, will be acknowledged by CSXT as owner of the  corridor in question. In exchange, NCRR grants \nCSXT the right to continue  its use of the corridor.  \n \nBoth companies agree to continue to accommodate Amtrak. CSXT also may add  up to two miles of double \ntrack to meet future capacity needs. The  settlement also allows the Triangle Transit Authority to use the  \nright-of-way north of the existing CSXT and Amtrak operations area between  Raleigh and Cary to build \nTTA‚Äôs regional rail transit tracks.  \n \n\"The resolution of this conflict ensures CSXT freight service to the  northeastern part of the state,\" says \nNCRR Chairman Sam Hunt. \"High  quality freight service is an important component for sustained \neconomic  growth and development. It is an asset for the businesses already located  northeast of Raleigh \nand can attract new industries considering locating  in the region. This will also allow TTA to go forward to \nfinalize their  regional rail plans.\"  \n \nCSX Corporation Chairman John Snow said, \"From the inception of the  Seaboard Air Line Railway in the \n1890s, this line has been a key part of  our railroad and our company‚Äôs success. North Carolina and its \nindustries  are important to CSX and we look forward to a close working relationship  with the North \nCarolina Railroad Company.\" \n \nThe NCRR‚Äôs mission is to manage, improve and protect North Carolina‚Äôs rail  properties and corridors in a \nmanner that will enhance passenger and  freight service and promote economic development.  CSXT and \nits 35,000 employees provide rail transportation and distribution  services over a 23,000 route-mile network \nin 23 states, the District of  Columbia and two Canadian provinces.

Under the 50-50 \nmatching provisions of the authorizing legislation, the States were required to obligate an equal \namount in support of this effort, in which Georgia is serving as the lead state. \nFurther information on the study, which covers the three-State region between Charlotte, \nAtlanta, and Macon in accordance with the designation of the Southeast Corridor, may be \nobtained from the Transportation Planning, Data, and Intermodal Development Division of the \nGeorgia Department of Transportation; their Internet address and contact list is at \nhttp://www.dot.state.ga.us/specialsubjects/contacts/index.shtml.   \n \nStatus of Environmental Work on Southeast Corridor, 20023\n \nNews Release from Rail Division, NCDOT: \nhttp://www.bytrain.org/redbarinfo/news/2002releases/feis731.html\n \nDate: July 31, 2002  \n \nSoutheast High-Speed Rail \nTier I Final Environmental Impact Statement Completed \n \nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation and the Virginia Department of Rail and Public \nTransportation have completed the Southeast High-Speed Rail Tier I Final Environmental Impact \nStatement (FEIS). \n \nThe Southeast High-Speed Rail project will develop and operate high-speed passenger rail service in the \n500-mile corridor from Washington, D.C. through Richmond, Va. and Raleigh, N.C. to Charlotte, N.C. In \nMarch, the transportation secretaries of North Carolina and Virginia announced the preferred route would \nextend from Washington, D.C. through Richmond, South Hill, Henderson, Raleigh and Greensboro to \nCharlotte. The route will also include a rail connection to Winston-Salem. \n \nThe FEIS document contains the analysis for selecting the preferred high-speed rail route, as well as public \nand agency comments ‚Äì and responses to those comments- on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. \nThe public can review the Final Environmental Impact Statement at 19 locations throughout the corridor. \nAll comments must be submitted to the NCDOT Rail Division by August 30. \n \nAfter the public, state, local and federal agencies review the FEIS, the U.S. Department of Transportation \nwill issue a Record of Decision, allowing the second study phase on the selected route to begin.

As these studies are completed, they will be used to acquire the \npermits needed for construction. \n \nDuring the past few years, the North Carolina Department of Transportation and Virginia Department of \nRail and Public Transportation held dozens of information workshops, formal public hearings and small \ngroup meetings to discuss the project and solicit public input. The agencies also conducted numerous \ninterviews with community leaders in both states. More than 80 percent of the feedback from both states \nindicated support for high-speed rail. Mayors, Chambers of Commerce and other business groups echoed \nthat support and worked together to tout the economic and quality-of-life benefits of a high-speed rail \nsystem. \n \nAlmost three years of environmental study and public involvement yielded information and analysis of \npotential environmental impacts, engineering feasibility, revenue, ridership, and costs. This analysis \nindicates the preferred route would have the best potential for high-speed rail service while having the \nfewest environmental impacts. \n \nHowever, completion of the Southeast High-Speed Rail Corridor is dependent on securing federal funds to \nhelp develop the route. Congress currently is considering several pieces of legislation that would provide \ndedicated funding for development of high-speed rail corridors. If funding is approved, the Washington to \nCharlotte corridor could be completed as early as 2010. The route would later be extended to Atlanta and \nMacon, Georgia, Columbia, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida. \n \nFor specific document review locations, click here. \n \n \n*** \n \nContacts: \nDavid Foster - NCDOT, dbfoster@dot.state.nc.us, 919-508-1917 \nTamara Neale - VDOT, Tamara .Neale@VirginiaDOT.org, 804-786-6458 \n \n \nService Improvements on North Carolina Portions  \nof Southeast Corridor \n \nNews Release from Rail Division, NCDOT: \nhttp://www.bytrain.org/redbarinfo/news/2002releases/trspeeddncclt.html  \n \nDate: July 1, 2002 \n \nTrain speeds to increase between Durham and Charlotte \n \nRaleigh - Beginning August 1, trains will travel a little faster along portions of the North Carolina Railroad \nbetween Durham and Charlotte. Train speeds will increase between five and 44 miles per hour, depending \non the stretch of track, and will shave about 10 minutes off the trip between the two cities. \n \n\"These speed increases follow years of work to make rail crossings safer and improve efficiency on the \nrailroad between Raleigh and Charlotte,\" said N.C. Transportation Secretary Lyndo Tippett. \"The time \nsavings may seem moderate now but, when combined with other slated improvements, will make the \npassenger rail service more auto competitive. In addition, these speed increases will be good for commerce \nbecause they will improve freight shipment efficiency.\" \n \n Supplement - 4\n--------------------------------Page End----------------------------------\n--------------------------------Page Start--------------------------------\n \nBetween Durham and Greensboro passenger train speeds will increase from the current 25-55 mph to a \nmaximum of 59 mph, while freight trains will increase from 15-45 mph up to a top speed of 49 mph. \nStraighter stretches of track between Greensboro and Charlotte will enable passenger trains along this \nsection to operate at top speeds of 79 mph, while freight trains will operate up to 60 mph. Maximum speeds \ncurrently range from 35-79 mph for passenger trains and 50-60 mph for freight trains. \n \nFor the past decade, state transportation officials have been working with local communities along the busy \nrail corridor to reduce the number of crossings and add protective devices to remaining crossings to deter \ndrivers from trying to beat the train. Since 1995, 25 crossings have been closed and 89 more have been \nupgraded with flashing lights, crossing gates or other such devices between Raleigh and Charlotte. \n \nAs the NCDOT was outfitting the rail crossings with flashing lights and gates, it also improved the signal \ncircuitry at each crossing. The crossings now include constant warning time devices, which signal the gates \nto lower 25-30 seconds before the train arrives regardless of what speed it is traveling. \n \n\"The constant warning time devices provide consistent advance notice to motorists, thereby improving \nsafety at these crossings.\" said Tippett. \"Drivers are more likely to heed the warning devices because they \nknow the train is imminent.\" \n \nThe department is partnering with Operation Lifesaver, a national public information and education \nprogram designed to prevent and reduce train crashes, to notify businesses nearest the railroad tracks about \nthe speed increases. They also plan to have several safety information blitzes to increase awareness among \nmotorists of the speed change. \n \n\"We do all we can to prevent injuries and fatalities at rail crossings,\" said NCDOT Rail Director Patrick \nSimmons. \"Ultimately, however, it is the driverxs responsibility to stop, look, listen and obey the crossing \nsignals.\" \n \nThe crossing improvements are part of a comprehensive project to improve efficiency, increase capacity \nand reduce travel time between Cary and Greensboro. The North Carolina Department of Transportation, in \npartnership with the North Carolina Railroad (NCRR) and Norfolk Southern Railway Company, is making \n$24 million worth of improvements to the tracks along the busy rail corridor. Enhancements include \nlengthening passing sidings, improving two railroad junctions, installing new train signals, banking some \nportions of track and installing a new centralized traffic control system. \n \nOnce all the work is completed- scheduled for 2004- travel time between the two cities will be reduced by \nat least 20 minutes. The NCDOT and Norfolk Southern are providing the engineering and design plans for \nthe projects and the NCDOT is paying for the rail improvements with state and federal funds.

<p>It looks like they have a more-or-less shared structure (6‚Äì7 items each), so we <em>should</em> be able to wrangle them into something more tidy.</p>

<h2>Data Tidying</h2>
<p>The number of headaches this induces depends on how deeply nested the items are. We‚Äôll start easy.</p>
<div id="level-1-beginner" class="section level3">
<h3>Level 1: Beginner</h3>
<p>Within <code>json_data</code>, each item contains just a few items that don‚Äôt contain nested lists. We can just use these directly to start building our tidy dataframe. Forunately, none of these contain null values, so we don‚Äôt have to deal with that headache. For details on this and other more advanced ways to build tidy dataframes from JSON lists, see <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ex26_ny-food-market-json.html">Jenny Bryan‚Äôs excellent purrr tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3>Level 2: Intermediate</h3>
<p>Most of the bits of data we are interested in are nested further down in the list though, so this approach won‚Äôt work for those. Instead, we will use <code>purrr::pluck()</code>, which as the name suggests ‚Äúplucks‚Äù more deeply nested elements out of the list.</p>
<p>To see how this works, let‚Äôs start with a single element of the JSON data that we want to turn into a column in our tidy dataframe. Take for example, the ‚ÄúscopeAndContentNote‚Äù field. This appears to contain photo captions, which could be quite interesting.</p>
<p>By examining the JSON data, we see ‚ÄúscopeAndContentNote‚Äù is nested within ‚Äúitem‚Äù, which is nested within ‚Äúdescription‚Äù. We can use these as input into <code>pluck</code> to extract just this element. Let‚Äôs try that just for the first record.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>scopeAndContentNote_location &lt;- list(&quot;description&quot;, &quot;item&quot;, &quot;scopeAndContentNote&quot;)
pluck(json_data, 1, scopeAndContentNote_location)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The full caption for this photograph reads: Manzanar Relocation Center, Manzanar, California. Pruning trees at this War Relocatin Authority center for evacuees of Japanese ancestry.\n&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Maybe we can map the <code>pluck</code> function over the whole list and thereby extract ‚ÄúscopeAndContentNote‚Äù?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map_chr(json_data, ~ pluck(., scopeAndContentNote_location))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error: Result 4 is not a length 1 atomic vector</code></pre>
<p>Nope, this doesn‚Äôt work because this field is missing for the fourth item in the JSON data.</p>
<p>We can get around this by setting the <code>.default</code> argument of <code>pluck</code> to <code>NA</code> (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1028967053875728384">Hadley Wickham for pointing this out!</a>)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map_chr(json_data, ~ pluck(., scopeAndContentNote_location, 
                           .default = NA_character_)) %&gt;% head</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;The full caption for this photograph reads: Manzanar Relocation Center, Manzanar, California. Pruning trees at this War Relocatin Authority center for evacuees of Japanese ancestry.\n&quot;

<p>There is still one potential problem to take care of before mapping <code>pluck</code> across the dataset: what if the element will try to <code>pluck</code> is itself a list with multiple elements? To get around this, let‚Äôs make a function to aggressively flatten lists and return a character vector of length one.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>collapse_list &lt;- function (x, collapse_char = &quot;; &quot;) {
  if (is.null(x)) {return (NA_character_)} # just in case
  if (is.list(x)) {
    unlist(x) %&gt;%
      paste(sep = &quot;_&quot;, collapse = collapse_char) -&gt; x
  }
  x
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use <code>pluck</code> in combination with <code>collapse_list</code> to extract this particular element from every result in <code>json_data</code>. Note the use of <code>~</code> to specify an anonymous function, with <code>.</code> to indicate the argument we‚Äôre mapping over.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>scopeAndContentNote &lt;- map_chr(json_data, ~ 
                               pluck(., scopeAndContentNote_location) %&gt;% 
                                 collapse_list)

<p>Cool! But how do we scale up to the rest of the elements we want to <code>pluck</code>?</p>
<p>First of all, we need an easy way to find the locations of the elements we are interested within this gaping black hole of a list. I manually typed in the (rather short) three levels to ‚ÄúscopeAndContentNote‚Äù, but I‚Äôd rather not do that for everything.</p>
<p>Here is where RStudio really shines, and it would be a much bigger pain without it. If you click on the <code>json_data</code> in the ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äù tab, or just type <code>View(json_data)</code> in the console, you‚Äôll get a view of the nested list similar to that produced by <code>jsonedit()</code>. We can drill down through the nested list and identify the bits of data that matter. Once you find something that you want to keep, click the ‚Äúcopy‚Äù icon on the right side. This will copy the double-bracket code needed to grab that element to the console.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a twitter-view of how that works:</p>
{{% tweet 1025111258666692608 %}}
<p>That‚Äôs very handy, but unfortunately <code>pluck</code> needs the directions to the thing to <code>pluck</code> either as a function or a list, not a bunch of strings in brackets. So, here is a fairly hacky function to convert a line of strings in brackets to a list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brackets_to_list &lt;- function (x) {
  gsub(&quot;]][[&quot;, &quot;_&quot;, x, fixed = TRUE) %&gt;%
    gsub(&quot;[[&quot;, &quot;&quot;, ., fixed = TRUE) %&gt;%
    gsub(&quot;]]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, ., fixed = TRUE) %&gt;%
    gsub(&#39;\&quot;&#39;, &quot;&quot;, ., fixed = TRUE) %&gt;%
    stringr::str_split(&quot;_&quot;) %&gt;%
    purrr::flatten()
}

title_location &lt;- &#39;[[&quot;description&quot;]][[&quot;item&quot;]][[&quot;title&quot;]]&#39;

brackets_to_list(title_location)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] &quot;description&quot;
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] &quot;item&quot;

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Manzanar Relocation Center, Manzanar, California. Pruning trees at this War Relocatin Authority cen . . .&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can now (finally) start scaling up by copying the ‚Äúaddresses‚Äù from RStudio‚Äôs list viewer into a list, then mapping that list onto <code>brackets_to_list</code>. Note that the ‚Äúaddresses‚Äù must be copied within single brackets (I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a <code>tidyeval</code> way around this but haven‚Äôt figured it out yet‚Ä¶ comments welcome).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>list(

<p>The next step is to map our anonymous plucking function (which works on one column) onto the full dataset (to go across all the columns). For this, we define a new function to pass to <code>map_df</code>. This nested mapping makes my head hurt, but it works. Note that the version here is restricted to character vectors, which works for this dataset, but may need to be changed for other cases. Again, <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ex26_ny-food-market-json.html">Jenny Bryan‚Äôs post</a> is the go-to.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>make_df &lt;- function (data, lookup_list, col_name) {

    tibble %&gt;% select(!!sym_col_name := .)

<p>Use <code>map_dfc</code> to bind the results by column, not row.</p>

<p>Great, we‚Äôre <em>almost</em> there. There‚Äôs one last tricky list element to tackle: user-contributed tags.

<p>Now, we can finally combine both sets of tags into the final vector.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tags &lt;- coalesce(single_tags, mult_tags)</code></pre>
<p>That <code>paste(collapse)</code> left a bunch of <code>&quot;&quot;</code> elements in our vector though. Let‚Äôs convert those to proper <code>NA</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tags &lt;- map_chr(tags, function (x) if (x == &quot;&quot;) {NA_character_} else {x})</code></pre>
<p>Now we can combine these with the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù columns into our tidy dataframe.</p>

<p>Hmmm‚Ä¶ interesting! Even this broad overview is providing a fascinating peek into the dataset. The ‚Äúitems‚Äù are mostly photographs, with the remaining 27% documents. Most of the photographs were taken by just a handful of people, Dorothea Lange being one of the more prolific.</p>
<p>Whew, just tidying the JSON data took up the whole blogpost. Hopefully I can get to data analysis in the next one.</p>
