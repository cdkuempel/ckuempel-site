The Relocation Center, as its name implies, was a temporary residence for those of Japanese ancestry who were transferred from their homes along the west coast under a war emergency measure of 1942. Many of the evacuees during the past three years were able to resettle and find new homes in the Middle West and eastern states. From September 1, 1945, to the closing date of October 15, 3,105 persons have gone back to their former homes or have relocated elsewhere.

Many have found permanent ""relocation"" in the sandy soil on which the tar paper barracks were hurriedly erected. A total of nearly 15,000 evacuees were inducted into the Granada Project, Amache, Colorado, since August 27, 1942, when the first group arrived from the Merced Assembly Center to prepare the camp for those to follow. The Relocation Center, as its name implies, was a temporary residence for those of Japanese ancestry who were transferred from their homes along the west coast under a war emergency measure of 1942. Many of the evacuees during the past three years were able to resettle and find new homes in the Middle West and eastern states. From September 1, 1945, to the closing date of October 15, 3,105 persons have gone back to their former homes or have relocated elsewhere. The last to leave the center a group of 126, left on two special coaches for Sacramento and nearby towns. At the peak of its population, Amache had 7,567 residents. 412 births were recorded and 107 deaths during the three years of its existence.

This report presents the guidelines from the perspective of the Project Manager, since this position carries the responsibilities for design and construction of a particular project, and possibly, for activation and operation of a facility or system. The Building Research Advisory Board (BRAM) Committee developed this study outlining these concerns: 1) developing project management for planning and executing urban construction projects; 2) assigning responsibility, authority, and control in the decision-making process; 3) developing the communication mechanisms and documentation required for implementation of management and construction; and 4) identifying procedures for initiating and developing management plans for urban construction projects. Using information gathered and the knowledge and expertise of its members, the Committee prepared this two-volume report. In this report. Volume II, supplementary information compiled by the Committee is presented from material reviewed and developed during the course of its study. It includes information on conceptual planning and examples of techniques and procedures that have been used which might be helpful to Project Managers in understanding the management process and in developing and executing project management plans.

57592077,description,5.0614548e-5,NA,"The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has identified roughly 250,523 public and private highway-rail grade crossings in the United States. Most aspects of jurisdiction over highway-rail grade crossings reside with the States. Within some States, responsibility is divided between several public agencies. In other states, jurisdiction over highway-rail grade crossings is assigned to a regulatory agency such as the public utility commission, public service commission, or state corporation commission. Still other states divide the authority among public administrative agencies of the state, county, city, and town having jurisdiction and responsibility for their respective highway systems. State and local law enforcement agencies are responsible for the enforcement of traffic laws at highway-rail grade crossings. In a number of cases, local governments are responsible for certain operational matters related to crossings and this is accomplished through various ordinances. This is a reference for researchers, engineers, students, and legal practitioners in the field of highway-rail grade crossing safety seeking state-specific laws and regulations affecting highway-rail grade crossings. This Sixth Edition publication provides an overview of new and existing state laws and regulations as of February 2013. Each chapter presents a different highway-rail grade crossing subject area and contains an introductory overview of the subject area. Moreover, unlike the Fifth Edition, excerpts from the laws of each individual state and the District of Columbia relative to the subject matter are presented, in order to serve as a practical tool for legislators, policymakers, and lawyers. In addition, each subject area is addressed from a practical orientation. Therefore, while there are some laws that deal with multiple subject areas, excerpts of applicable statutes have been published in the most relevant sections.",Textual Records,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://catalog.archives.gov/OpaAPI/media/57592077/opa-renditions/thumbnails/13-020358_Compilation_of_State_Laws_final_3_2014.pdf-thumb.jpg,NA,Electronic Records Archives (ERA),"NA"

57592177,description,2.6809535e-6,NA,"Rail transit represents a family of modes ranging from light rail to regional rapid transit systems, and it can be utilized in a number of different cities and types of applications. Many European cities of medium size employ very successfully light rail mode for gradual upgrading of transit service into partially or fully separated high speed, reliable transit systems. Analysis of these cities show that with population densities and auto ownership very similar to those in the United States cities, their transit systems offer a superior service and have much better usage than our cities. Many modern features of light rail technology are not known in this country. Wider use of different rail systems, greatly increased transit financing, introduction of more qualified personnel into transit industry, and improved transit planning and implementation procedures are recommended to close the gap in urban transportation between some more progressive European cities and their counterparts in this country.",Textual Records,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://catalog.archives.gov/OpaAPI/media/57592177/opa-renditions/thumbnails/1972_LIGHT_RAIL_TRANSIT_SYSTEMS_A_DEFINITION_AND_EVAL.PDF-thumb.jpg,NA,Electronic Records Archives (ERA),"NA"

57592259,description,2.144763e-6,NA,"Track and structure characteristics and problem areas to be encountered in upgrading the Corridor are discussed. Standards considerations and applicability are outlined along with the maintenance history of the Corridor. Track system options for application to 150 MPH High Speed Rail (HSR) service are discussed and performance records examined. Concrete ties, fastener systems and ballast less track (concrete slab) are considered with wood tie track in a structural and cost effective investigation. Factors of type and frequency level of HSR train service and potential joint usage with freight movements are projected for these analyses. With this information, design parameters such as lateral and vertical track stability are investigated and established. On basis of structural integrity, selected track system candidates are costed over a 50 year life cycle of construction and maintenance. All projected maintenance items are described in detail with cycle rationale delineated. As a result, ballast less track is rejected and both concrete and wood tie ballasted track system with 132# rail are recommended for applications to designated segments of the HSR System. Recommended standards for roadway section, subgrade, drainage, horizontal and vertical alignment, track structure components, turnouts and track geometry parameters are described. Bridge and tunnel standards are also designated.

57595305,description,2.144763e-6,NA,"[From the Introduction] In 1971, FRA commissioned the Transportation Systems Center (TSC) to analyze the responsibilities of the railroad train dispatcher. The report of this study, which was entitled ""An Analysis of the Job of Railroad Train Dispatcher"" was published in 1974. Today, 19 years after FRA commissioned the first study, the conditions described in that summary continue to exist on most railroads. What was then state-of-the-art technology is now part of a system which a railroad may or may not decide to retain. Current technology includes computer dependent traffic control systems, computer systems which use operating rules logic to help regulate the issuance of mandatory directives, and computerized communication systems which route and store radio and telephone calls until connection with the dispatcher is accomplished.",Textual Records,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://catalog.archives.gov/OpaAPI/media/57595305/opa-renditions/thumbnails/1990_NATIONAL_TRAIN_DISPATCHER_SAFETY_ASSESSMENT_1987.PDF-thumb.jpg,NA,Electronic Records Archives (ERA),"NA"

57593033,description,1.0723815e-6,NA,"This document is the final environmental impact statement and final environmental impact report (FEIS/R) on the proposal by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) to complete the electrification of the Northeast Corridor main line by extending electric traction from New Haven, CT, to Boston, MA. This FEIS/R supplements the draft document published in October 1993 and made available for public comment through January 21, 1994. Comments received on the Draft EIS/R have been reviewed and evaluated. In some cases design refinements were made, additional analyses were performed and further explanations of potential impacts were incorporated into the FEIS/R as a result of those comments. This FEIS/R presents a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of each project alternative on the natural, physical and social environment. Environmental consequences are identified and, where possible, quantified. Mitigation measures that will reduce or eliminate potential adverse impacts are also identified. The FEIS/R consists of four volumes. This document (Volume I) is the main body of the FEIS/R and includes a 4(f) Statement on the proposed location of an electrification facility in the Great Swamp Wildlife Management Area. Volume II presents additional technical studies to supplement Volume III of the DEIS/R issued in October 1993.

Although the literature which is referenced does in a few cases date back three decades, all listings are considered pertinent to contemporary railroad safety problems. The volume is divided into three main categories (with sections listed after each): Improved Track Structures Research (Track Accident Reduction, Improved Track Performance); Rail Vehicle Safety Research (Rolling Stock/Safety, Rolling Stock/Track-Train Dynamics, Locomotives/Safety, Locomotives/ Track-Train Dynamics, Hazardous Materials Cars, Grade Crossings, Human Factors, Control Systems); Improved Inspection, Detection and Testing Research (Track Inspection and Testing, Automated Track Inspection, Vehicle Inspection, Life Cycle Testing). All of the citations in this Bibliography appear also in one of the regular RRIS semiannual publications. Because it cites only safety-related topics, this Bibliography should not be considered a comprehensive collection of RRIS citations; it incorporates about one-fourth of all RRIS holdings. There are 4,368 listings, involving 3,131 abstracts of research reports and journal articles, and descriptions of computer programs with some individual citations appearing in more than one of the 14 sections. The categories in this Bibliography are based on the functional responsibilities of the groups comprising the staff of the FRA Office of Rail Safety Research; these categories differ from the regular RRIS classification scheme.
