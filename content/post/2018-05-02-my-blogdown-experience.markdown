I recently decided to completely overhaul my personal website using [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). There are already some great [posts](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/#going-further) on this topic, so I won't go into too much detail. Rather, I will just provide some thoughts on what worked well and where I had difficulty.
