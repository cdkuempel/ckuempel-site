abstract = "Polyphlebium borbonicum is newly recorded in Central and South America and Easternmost Polynesia (Marquesas and Society Islands). It has been misidentified as P. diaphanum and as P. endlicherianum in the New World and in the Pacific, respectively. Polyphlebium borbonicum is distinguishable from true P. diaphanum by broader blade segments, and from true P. endlicherianum by the absence of a marginal elongate cell row of the lamina."
