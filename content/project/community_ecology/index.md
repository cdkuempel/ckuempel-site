One central question in biology is, “why do certain species tend to live together?” I am interested in how fern species interact to form communities. I investigate this topic using methods that take into account the evolutionary history of species when modeling community assembly processes. I study fern community assembly at two tropical field sites, [Moorea](http://www.moorea.berkeley.edu/) (French Polynesia) and [Nectandra](http://www.nectandra.org/) (Costa Rica).
